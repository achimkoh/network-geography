                  MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

Adopted: September 26, 2000             Released: September 27, 2000

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division, International Bureau:

                         I.INTRODUCTION

 1.  In this Order, we grant the applications of World Access, Inc. (World Access) and
Communication TeleSystems International d/b/a WorldxChange (WorldxChange) (collectively,
Applicants), seeking authority to transfer to World Access interests in certain submarine cable
landing licenses of WorldxChange and international Section 214 authorizations (and applications
for international Section 214 authority) of WorldxChange, and to assign these interests,
authorizations, and applications for  authority, to a surviving corporation, WorldxChange
Communications, Inc. (WorldxChange Communications), in connection with the proposed
merger of World Access and WorldxChange.
                         II.BACKGROUND

 2.  On May 15, 2000, Applicants concurrently filed two applications, one seeking authority
under the Cable Landing License Act to transfer control of cable landing licenses, and one
seeking authority under Section 214 of the Communications Act, as amended, to transfer control
of Section 214 authorizations.  On June 20, 2000 Applicants filed a supplement to their
applications to include an additional Section 214 authorization and to clarify certain ambiguities
regarding the name of WorldxChange.  On September 7, 2000, Applicants filed a letter advising
the Commission that the lists of cable landing licenses and Section 214 authorizations provided
in the initial applications and Supplemental Filing were complete.  The September 7, 2000
Letter also clarified the description of one Section 214 authorization listed in the Section 214
Transfer Application.  On September 20, 2000, Applicants filed a letter revising the list of
WorldxChange's Section 214 authorizations included in the Section 214 Transfer Application. 

 3.  WorldxChange, a California corporation based in San Diego, California, is a global
telecommunications company that specializes in providing high-quality, low-cost services to
retail and wholesale customers in 13 countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, the
United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Chile, Guatemala, Australia, Canada, and New
Zealand. According to Applicants, WorldxChange operates 45 switches that are connected by an
extensive network of owned and leased undersea and land-based fiber optic cables. 
WorldxChange holds numerous Section 214 authorizations, as well as several cable landing
licenses and an earth station license, and is regulated as a non-dominant carrier on all routes.

 4.  World Access, a Delaware corporation based in Atlanta, Georgia, is a provider of bundled
voice, data, and Internet services to key regions of the world, and through its licensed
subsidiaries, competitively provides end-to-end voice and data communications services
including frame relay, IP, ATM, and multimedia applications.  According to Applicants,
subsidiaries of World Access hold numerous Section 214 and cable landing licenses, and are
subject to non-dominant regulatory treatment on all routes.

 5.  World Access and WorldxChange have entered into an agreement whereby World Access
would acquire WorldxChange through the exchange of shares of stock.  Upon completion of the
merger WorldxChange will become a subsidiary of World Access. Specifically, WorldxChange
will be merged with and into WorldxChange Communications, a Delaware corporation that is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of World Access that was formed to effectuate the acquisition. 
Applicants assert that, following the merger, the current business of WorldxChange will be
conducted through WorldxChange Communications which will hold, and will continue to
provide service under, WorldxChange's existing licenses and authorizations.  Through the
acquisition of WorldxChange, World Access will acquire control of  WorldxChange's interests
in the following cable landing licenses: COLUMBUS-III; MAYA-1, Guam Philippines
Cable System; AMERICAS-II, and the Pan American Cable System.  In addition, World
Access will acquire control of WorldxChange's Section 214 authorizations identified in
Appendix B of this Order, including Section 214 authorizations associated with submarine cable
landing licenses. Applicants also noted that World Access recently entered into an agreement to
purchase STAR Telecommunications, Inc. (STAR).  On September 8, 2000, the International
Bureau's Telecommunications Division released an Order granting the joint applications of
World Access and STAR seeking authority to transfer to World Access control of international
Section 214 authorizations, as well as interests in certain submarine cable landing licenses held
by STAR, in connection with the proposed merger of World Access and STAR.

 6.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License
Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the
application to transfer control of and assign WorldxChange's interest in the submarine cable
landing licenses.  The Department of State, after coordinating with the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of Defense, has no
objection to proposed transfers and assignments.

                         III.DISCUSSION

 7.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(a)(8) of the Commission's rules,  World Access is required to
disclose its affiliations with foreign carriers.  According to the Applications, World Access is
affiliated with nondominant foreign carriers in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, El Salvador, Finland,
France, Germany, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.  In addition, Applicants note that,
following its planned merger with STAR, World Access will also become affiliated with and
control the nondominant foreign carrier affiliates of STAR, which include affiliations with
carriers in Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan.  Because these countries are
Members of the World Trade Organization, we presume that World Access' affiliations with
these carriers do not pose concerns that would justify denying these applications.  Moreover,
Applicants have certified that no foreign affiliate of World Access holds a fifty percent or greater
market share in its respective market, which Applicants certify will remain true even if World
Access consummates its proposed merger with STAR.

 8.  We conclude that grant of the application to transfer and assign interests in cable landing
licenses is consistent with the Cable Landing License Act and that grant of the application to
transfer and assign the international Section 214 authorizations and applications for Section 214
authority is consistent with Section 214 and the Commission's regulations governing that
section.  We therefore consent to the transfer of control of WorldxChange to World Access. 
With respect to the cable landing licenses, this Order constitutes a modification of the initial
authorizations to reflect these transfers of control and assignments.  We do not modify the initial
authorizations in any other respect.

                      IV.ORDERING CLAUSES
