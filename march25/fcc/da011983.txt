MODIFICATION OF CABLE LANDING LICENSE AND SECTION 214 AUTHORIZATION

   Adopted:  August 22, 2001            Released: August 23, 2001

By the Associate Chief, Telecommunications Division, International Bureau:

                      I.Introduction
1.In this Order, we modify the cable landing license for the Pan American Cable System (Pan
American) to add Enron Broadband Services, Inc. (Enron or Applicant) as an additional party to the
license. The original license authorized several parties, pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act, and
Executive Order No. 10530, to land and operate Pan American, a common carrier fiber optic submarine
cable system extending between the U.S. Virgin Islands, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, Colombia,
Venezuela, and Aruba.  We also modify the section 214 authorization for Pan American to include
Enron as an authorization holder.  The original authorization authorized several parties, pursuant to
section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to construct, acquire and operate capacity
                        in Pan American.
2.On March 5, 2001, Enron filed the instant Application, and on April 26, 2001 Enron
supplemented its Application.   In its Application, Enron states it only recently confirmed that it holds a
small equity share in Pan American, and asks the Commission to grant its Application pursuant to the
enforcement amnesty announced by the Commission's International and Enforcement bureaus.   In its
April 26 Letter, Enron provides a table from the construction, maintenance and administration (C&MA)
agreement for the Pan American cable system, which lists the voting interests of the owners.  The C&MA
table shows that Enron holds a 0.20435 percent voting interest in the Pan American cable system, in
               proportion to its equity stake.  
3.Applicant states that it currently holds a section 214 authorization to provide global facilities-
based and global resale services.  Applicant also states that it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Enron
Corp., an Oregon corporation engaged in the business of providing wholesale and retail energy services,
pipeline transportation services, and communications services in the United States and abroad, and that
Enron Corp., which is publicly traded, has no 10-percent-or-greater shareholders.  According to the
Application, Enron has no interlocking directorates with foreign carriers and is not a foreign carrier or
affiliated with a foreign carrier.  Applicant asks to be treated as a non-dominant carrier for purposes of
this Application.  Applicant also certifies that it has not agreed, and will not agree, to accept any direct
or indirect special concessions from a foreign carrier with respect to any U.S. international route where
the foreign carrier possesses market power on the foreign end of the route.
                        IV.Comments
5.We placed the Application on public notice on March 23, 2001.  We received no comments. 
Pursuant to section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License Act, and Executive
Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the Application.  The Department of State,
after coordinating with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the
Department of Defense, stated that it has no objection to approving the Applicant's request to be added to
                  the cable landing license.  
                       VI.Discussion
7.We grant the Applicant's requests to modify the Pan American cable system landing license to
add Enron as a licensee and to modify the Pan American cable system section 214 authorization to add
Enron as an authorization holder.  Applicant asserts that grant of its Application is in the public interest
because it would permit other carriers and business customers to have greater access to, and choice
among, innovative services offered at lower prices on U.S.-Caribbean and U.S.-Latin America routes,
and would provide international connectivity for Applicant's domestic terrestrial network.  Applicant
further notes that the Application raises no foreign affiliation or competitive issues warranting
Commission scrutiny on public interest grounds.  Finally, Applicant advises that although it failed to
seek Commission approval prior to acquiring its small equity stake in the Pan American cable system, it
has not used the capacity to date to provide services between the United States and foreign points.
8.We note that, while it is unusual for a party that is not a current licensee to seek to amend a
cable landing license, in this case Enron has provided documentation regarding its current status as an
equity shareholder in the Pan American cable system in support of its Application to correct its earlier
failure to seek Commission approval.  We conclude that adding Enron to the cable landing license for the
Pan American cable system raises no competitive concerns.  Specifically, we conclude that Enron's
0.20435 percent voting and equity interest will not cause competitive harm. Accordingly, we find that
grant of the Application is consistent with the Cable Landing License Act and with section 214 and the
Commission's regulations governing that section, and is in the public interest.
                    IX.Ordering Clauses
10.Consistent with the foregoing and pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act, Executive
Order No. 10530, and section 214 of the Communications Act, as amended, 47 U.S.C.  34-39, 3 U.S.C.

American cable section 214 authorization ARE MODIFIED, respectively, to add Enron as a joint
               licensee and authorization holder.
11.This Modification of Cable Landing License and section 214 Authorization does not modify
any other terms or conditions imposed in the license or authorization.
