                            CABLE LANDING LICENSE

Adopted:  January 20, 2000                           Released:  January 21, 2000

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                        I.  Introduction

     1.   In this Order, we grant the Application of Level 3 International, Inc. (Level 3) under the
Cable Landing License Act and Executive Order No. 10530 for authority to land and operate a
private fiber optic submarine cable system extending between the United States and the United
Kingdom.  This system will be operated on a non common carrier basis.  We find that Level 3 has
provided sufficient information under our rules to comply with the Cable Landing License Act and
that it would serve the public interest to grant the cable landing license subject to the conditions
listed below. 

                        II.  Application

     2.   According to the Application, Level 3, a Delaware corporation, is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of  PKS Information Services, Inc. (PKS), a Delaware corporation, which, in turn, is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Level 3 Communications, Inc. (Level 3 Communications), a Delaware
corporation. Level 3 is affiliated with various foreign carriers, all of which are non-dominant
carriers that do not operate in the United Kingdom, the only foreign landing point for the Level 3
cable.

     3.   According to the Application, the proposed Level 3 system will consist of eight
fiber cables designed to carry 32 wavelengths each, with the potential to carry 40 to 48
wavelengths each; 32 OC-192s increasing to 128 OC-192s at 1.2 terabits per second.  The cable
will connect Shirley/Bellport, New York and Widemouth Bay, England.
                         III.  Comments

     4    We placed the Application on public notice on September 29, 1999.  We did not
receive any comments.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable
Landing License Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of
the Application.  The Department of State, after coordinating with the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of Defense, stated that
it has no objection to issuance of the cable landing license.
     
                        IV.  Discussion

     A.   Private Submarine Cable Policy

     5.   Level 3 proposes to operate the cable as a non common carrier submarine cable
system in which capacity will not be offered indifferently to the user public.  Level 3 requests a
license under the Commission's private submarine cable policy, which is intended to promote
competition in the provision of international transmission facilities.  Pursuant to this policy, the
Commission has authorized non common carrier cables where: (1) there is no legal compulsion to
serve the public indifferently; and (2) there are no reasons implicit in the nature of the operations
to expect the applicant would make capacity available to the public indifferently and
indiscriminately.
          6.   In applying the first prong of the test to submarine cable
          authorizations, the Commission has stated that there will be no legal compulsion to
          serve the public indifferently where there is no public interest reason to require
          facilities to be offered on a common carrier basis.  This public interest analysis
          has generally focused on whether an applicant will be able to exercise market
          power because of the lack of alternative facilities.  Where there are sufficient
          alternatives, the Commission has found that the licensee will lack market power
          and will not be able to charge monopoly rates for cable capacity.  The
          Commission has found that, in those circumstances, the public interest would be
          served by allowing a submarine cable to be offered on a non-common carrier
          basis.
     
          7.   We note that there are sufficient existing and planned facilties on
          the route to prevent Level 3 from exercising market power in offering services to
          the public.  The cable systems in this region include the following cables extending
          between the United States and various points in Western Europe including the
          United Kingdom:  (1) TAT-8, (2) TAT-9; (3) TAT 11; (4) TAT-12/13; (5)
          Atlantic Crossing-1 (AC-1), (6) FLAG Atlantic-1; (7) Project Oxygen, and (8)
          TAT-14.  TAT-8, TAT-9, TAT-11, TAT-12/13, and AC-1 are all operational
          cables.  The FLAG Atlantic-1, TAT-14 and Project Oxygen cable systems have
          been authorized by the Commission, but we are not yet aware of whether or not
          these cables are operational.  The FLAG Atlantic-1, TAT-14, and Project Oxygen
          cable systems will extend between the United States and the United Kingdom and
          other international points.
          8.   No one has advocated that the public interest requires Level 3 to operate
          its cable on a common carrier basis.  In addition, Level 3 is affiliated with several foreign
          carriers in Europe, none of which has market power or does business in the United
          Kingdom, the only landing point of the proposed cable.  Therefore Level 3 does not control
          any bottleneck facilities in the markets the Level 3 system proposes to serve.
          9.   Given the unopposed evidence of the availability of alternative cables and
          Level 3's representation that none of its affiliates has market power in any of the cable
          landing countries, we find that it would not serve the public interest to impose common
          carrier regulation on the operations of the Level 3 system at this time.  We note, however,
          that we maintain the ability to impose common carrier or common-carrier-like obligations
          on the operations of this or any other submarine cable system if the public interest so
          requires.  Furthermore, we have always maintained the authority to classify facilities as
          common carrier facilities subject to Title II of the Communications Act if the public
          interest requires that the facilities be offered to the public indifferently.
          10.  Regarding the second prong of the test, we conclude that there is no
          reason to expect that capacity in the proposed cable system would be held out to the public
          indifferently.  Level 3 states that capacity will not be sold indifferently to the user public. 
          Instead, capacity will be assigned pursuant to "individualized decisions."  We therefore
          conclude that Level 3 will operate the Level 3 system on a non-common carrier basis. 
          11.  We conclude that Level 3 will not offer capacity in the Level 3 system to
          the public on a common carrier basis and that the public interest does not require that they
          do so.  Accordingly, we conclude that it is appropriate to license the Level 3 system on a
          non-common carrier basis.  We also find that Level 3 will not provide a
          telecommunications service for a fee to such a class of users as to be "effectively available
          directly to the public" and thus will not be a "telecommunications carrier" under the
          Telecommunications Act of 1996.
     B.   Ownership and Landing Points

     12.  Level 3 has provided the ownership information required by Section 1.767(a)(6) and
Section 63.18 of the Commission's rules.  The Applicant will own the United States landing site as well as
the wet portion of the cable within U.S. territorial waters.  The wet portion of the cable in international
waters will be owned by Level 3 (Bermuda) Ltd.  The United Kingdom landing site as well as the wet
portion of the cable within the territorial waters of the United Kingdom will be owned by Level 3
Communications Limited (UK).
           
     13.  The Application states that the Level 3 system cable landing station in the United States
will be located at 957 Station Road, Bellport, New York.  The beach landing site will be located at
coordinates 40 degrees 44.10390' north, 72 degrees 51.96073' west.  In the United Kingdom, the beach
landing site will be located at coordinates 50 degrees 47.596' north, 4 degrees 33.407' west.  The cable
landing station will be located near Widemouth Bay.  The exact location of the landing station has not yet
been established, but it is anticipated to be within 5 kilometers of the beach landing site at the following
coordinates:  50 degrees 49.45' north, 4 degrees 32.25' west.  Applicant will provide the exact location of
the cable landing station when it is known.  Maps of both cable landing sites are included with the
Application.  

          C.   Environmental Impact

     14.  The Commission has found that the construction of new submarine cable systems,
individually and cumulatively, will not have a significant effect on the environment and therefore should be
expressly excluded from our procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 
Therefore, the Applicant is not required to submit an environmental assessment, and this
Application is categorically excluded from environmental processing.

                         V.  Conclusion

     15.  We grant Level 3's Application for authority to land and operate a non-common
carrier fiber optic submarine cable extending between the United States and the United Kingdom,
subject to the conditions listed below. 
                                
                     VI.  Ordering Clauses

     16.  Consistent with the foregoing, we hereby GRANT AND ISSUE Level 3 a license
to land and operate a non common carrier fiber optic submarine cable system  (consisting of eight
fiber cables, extending between landing points at cable stations at Shirley, New York, and
Widemouth Bay, United Kingdom) under the provisions of the Cable Landing License Act and
Executive Order 10530.  This grant is subject to all rules and regulations of the Commission; any
treaties or conventions relating to communications to which the United States is or may hereafter
become a party; any action by the Commission or the Congress of the United States rescinding,
changing, modifying, or amending any rights accruing to any person hereunder; and the following
conditions:
