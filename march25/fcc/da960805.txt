                          ORDER AND AUTHORIZATION

Adopted: May 17, 1996              Released:

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

          1.   International Telecommunications Corporation (ITC)
filed an application, pursuant to Section 214 of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, for authority to acquire
and operate facilities in the TAT-12/13, RIOJA, ODIN and
EURAFRICA Cable Systems.  ITC also filed an application to amend
the Cable Landing License for the TAT-12/13 Cable System to
include ITC as an owner.  The applications were placed on public
notice on October 20, and 27, 1995, respectively.  No comments
were received.

          2.   ITC, a Delaware corporation, is in the business of
providing common carrier communications services between the
United States and overseas points.  ITC seeks to acquire on an
ownership basis facilities in the TAT-12/13, RIOJA and ODIN Cable
Systems, and on an Indefeasible Right of User (IRU) basis
facilities in the EURAFRICA Cables System, for provision of its
authorized international services.  Since it is seeking to
acquire the TAT-12/13 facilities on an ownership basis, it must
additionally seek modification of the Cable Landing License to
add itself as an owner.
          3.   In the matter before us, the Department of State,
in coordination with the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration and the Department of Defense, has
advised the Commission that it has no objection to the issuance
of an amended TAT-12/13 Cable Landing License.

            4.    Upon consideration of the applications and in view
of the foregoing, we find that the present and future public
convenience and necessity require a grant of the instant
applications.

            5.    Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that applications File
Nos. I-T-C-95-568 and S-C-L-93-004(M) ARE GRANTED, and:
      
      a.    ITC is authorized to:

            i.    acquire on an ownership basis a one-half interest
            in and operate  one E-1 circuit in the TAT-12/13 Cable
            System for provision of its regularly authorized
            services between the United States, on the one hand, 
            and Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark,
            Finland, France, Germany, Gibraltar, Greece, Hungary,
            Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Monaco,
            Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia,
            Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and the United Kingdom, on
            the other hand;

            ii.   acquire on an ownership basis a one-half interest
            in and operate one E-1 circuit in the RIOJA and ODIN
            Cable Systems for provision of its regularly authorized
            services between the United States, on the one hand,
            and Denmark, Finland and Norway, on the other hand;  

            iii.  acquire on an (IRU) basis a one-half interest in
            and operate  one E-1 circuit in the EURAFRICA Cable
            System for provision of its regularly authorized
            services between the United States and France, Madeira
            Islands, Portugal and Spain, on the other hand;
      
            iv. lease and operate any necessary domestic connecting
            facilities and a one-half interest in any necessary
            overseas connecting facilities.

      b.    the TAT-12/13 Cable Landing License is amended to 
      include ITC as an owner and a licensee under the provisions

      Submarine Cables in the United States", 47 U.S.C. Sections
