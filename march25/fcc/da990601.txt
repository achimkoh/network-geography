           SECOND MODIFICATION OF CABLE LANDING LICENSE

Adopted:  March 29, 1999                           Released:  March 31, 1999  

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                         I.  Introduction

     1.    In this Order, we modify the cable landing license recently granted to fONOROLA Fiber
Development Inc. (fONOROLA Fiber) and Ledcor Industries, Inc. (Ledcor) to add Fiberco
Telecommunications Corporation (Fiberco) as a third licensee.  The original license authorized
fONOROLA Fiber and Ledcor to land and operate a fiber optic submarine cable system between the
United States and Canada called "America-Canada-1" or "AmeriCan-1."  Pursuant to the modified license,
AmeriCan-1 will continue to be operated on a non-common carrier basis.  

                          II.  Comments 

     2.   We placed the application on public notice on December 4, 1998.  We received no
comments.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License Act, and
Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the application.  After coordinating
with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of Defense, the
Department of State stated that it has no objection to amending the cable landing license, which was
initially granted on August 19, 1998.
     
                        III.  Discussion
     
     3.   We grant Fiberco's request to be added as a third licensee of AmeriCan-1.   Fiberco
requests the modification in order to purchase a portion of AmeriCan-1, including one of the four fiber
bundles and an undivided interest in certain support structures including cable landing stations in the
United States.  

     4.   We find that the proposed modification is in the public interest.  Fiberco, a Delaware
corporation, is indirectly owned by BCE Inc., a publicly-traded Canadian holding company, which also
owns 100% of Bell Canada.  Because Canada is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), we
adopt a presumption that the addition of Fiberco as a licensee does not raise concerns that would justify
denial of its application on competition grounds.  Indeed, as the application states, the addition of Fiberco
to the instant license will further expand the extent of facilities-based competition for services between the
United States and Canada.  According to Fiberco, its Canadian affiliate, Bell Canada, already competes
with Call Net and other carriers in the cross-border market, and the scope of such competition is expected
to increase pursuant to the October 1, 1998, decision of the Canadian Radio-television and
Telecommunications Commission, which lifted remaining restrictions on Canada-overseas and Canada-
Canada traffic carried via the United States.
     
                     IV.  Ordering Clauses 
                                
     5.   Consistent with the foregoing and pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act and
Executive Order 10530, IT IS ORDERED that application, File No. SCL-AMD-19981112-00026, IS
GRANTED and the AmeriCan-1 landing license is MODIFIED to add Fiberco as a licensee of AmeriCan-
1.

     6.   This Modification of Cable Landing License does not modify any other terms or conditions
imposed in the license released on August 21, 1998.

     7.   This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  0.261,
and is effective upon adoption.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106 or
applications for review under Section 1.115 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.106, 1.115, may be
filed within 30 days of the date of public notice of this order.
