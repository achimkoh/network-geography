                          CABLE LANDING LICENSE


      Adopted:  November 5, 1996              Released:  November 7, 1996

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

1.      In this Order, we grant the application of Orient Express Communications, L.L.C.,
(Orient Express) under the Cable Landing License Act for authority to land and operate a digital
fiber optic submarine cable to be called the "Orient Express Cable System" extending between
the United States Territory of Guam and the Philippines, Hong Kong, the People's Republic of
China, and the Republic of Korea.  The cable will be operated on a non common carrier basis. 
We find that Orient Express has provided sufficient information under our rules to comply with
the Cable Landing License Act and therefore grant the cable landing license subject to the
conditions listed below.

                              The Application

2.      Orient Express is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Virginia.  All of its owners and officers are U.S. citizens.  The applicant
proposes to land and operate the Orient Express Cable System as a non common carrier system
in which capacity would be sold or leased to users on a non-tariffed, non common carrier basis. 
The cable system would be owned by the applicant and by entities authorized to land and operate
an international submarine fiber optic cable system in the Philippines, Hong Kong, the People's
Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea.  All of the proposed cable system's plant and
equipment located in the United States would be owned by Orient Express.  All plant and
equipment located in the Philippines, Hong Kong, the People's Republic of China, and the
Republic of Korea would be owned by entities authorized to land and operate an international
submarine fiber optic cable system in those jurisdictions.  The precise landing points have yet
to be selected.  Orient Express states that the landing points will be in conformity with plans
approved by the Secretary of the Army and all necessary and appropriate agencies of the
governments of the Philippines, Hong Kong, the People's Republic of China, and the Republic
of Korea.  The proposed cable system is scheduled to be operational in the second quarter of
1998.

3.      The Orient Express Cable System will employ 1.55-micrometer wavelength
technology operating on each of its fiber pairs at a minimum of 2.5 Gbps per fiber pair.  The
capacity on each fiber pair will be provided in a minimum of sixteen 155-Mbps streams, with
each 155-Mbps stream containing 63 Minimum Investment Units (MIUs).  Each MIU, the
minimum unit of ownership investment in the cable system, consists of a 2.048-Mbps stream. 
The applicant states that the planning and development of the Orient Express Cable System will
be based upon the use of submarine fiber optic technology judged suitable for implementation
at the projected ready for commercial service (RFCS) date, employing the appropriate
transmission rate necessary to meet the capacity requirements of the users of the system.  Orient
Express expects that the minimum system design capacity will be 10.0 Gbps.  Orient Express
states that it will ensure system reliability through the deployment of the appropriate cable
system design.

4.      The proposed cable system will consist of twelve segments, designated A through L. 
Segment A is the cable landing station to be located in the U.S. Territory of Guam.  Segment
B is the cable landing station to be located in the northeastern portion of the Philippines. 
Segment C is the cable landing station to be located in Hong Kong.  Segment D is the cable
landing station to be located in or near Shanghai, the People's Republic of China.  Segment E
is the cable landing station in the southeastern portion of the Republic of Korea.   Segment F
consists of the whole of the submarine cable system between the system interface at Segment A
and branching unit #1 (BU1).  Segment G consists of the whole of the submarine cable system
between BU1 and branching unit #2 (BU2).  Segment H consists of the whole of the submarine
cable system between BU2 and the system interface at Segment B.  Segment I consists of the
whole of the submarine cable system between BU2 and the system interface at Segment C. 
Segment J consists of the whole of the submarine cable system between BU1 and branching unit
#3 (BU3).  Segment K consists of the whole of the submarine cable system between BU3 and
the system interface at Segment D.  Segment L consists of the whole of the submarine cable
system between BU3 and the system interface at Segment E.  Segment F will consist of four
fiber pairs, Segment G three, Segment H three, Segment I two, Segment J three, Segment K
three, and Segment L two.

5.      Orient Express states that it intends to sell or lease, on a long-term basis, bulk
capacity in the Orient Express Cable System to large users and telecommunications providers
on a highly individualized basis.  It states that it will make "individualized decisions, in
particular cases, whether and on what terms to deal" and does not intend to undertake "to carry
for all people indifferently" and that there is no public-interest reason for the Commission to
require that the proposed facilities be operated on a common carrier basis.  It asserts that we
therefore have only to consider the requirements of the Cable Landing License Act to act on this
application.

6.      Orient Express states that the proposed cable system will provide needed additional
voice, video and high-speed data transmission capacity between and among the United States via
the Territory of Guam, the Philippines, Hong Kong, the People's Republic of China, the
Republic of Korea, and points beyond.  It will also interconnect with the domestic and
international interexchange telecommunications networks of the United States, the Philippines,
Hong Kong, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, and points beyond.  Orient
Express states that the cable system will also provide high reliability and low-cost capacity,
redundancy, security, and restoration.

                                 Comments

7.      The Orient Express application was placed on public notice on October 13, 1995. 
AT&T Submarine Systems, Inc., (AT&T-SSI) filed comments on November 13, 1995, and
Orient Express filed Reply Comments on November 22.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the
Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, we
informed the Department of State of Orient Express's application.  The Department of State,
after coordinating with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and
the Department of Defense, stated that it has no objection to the issuance of the cable landing
license.

8.      In its comments, AT&T-SSI states that it favors a fully competitive private cable
industry in which the market determines a private cable system's viability.  AT&T-SSI requests
that if we grant this license, we make clear the Commission's pro-competition policy by stating
that the grant does not preclude the licensing of future cable systems, whether common carrier
or private, that could be competitive alternatives.  Orient Express responds that no clarification
is necessary because the Commission has never considered private cable system applications to
be mutually exclusive and has never precluded the licensing of such systems because of
overcapacity on existing and future systems.

                                Discussion

9.      Orient Express requests a license under the Commission's private submarine cable
policy to promote competition in the provision of international transmission facilities.  Pursuant
to this policy, the Commission has authorized non common carrier cables where there is no
legal compulsion to serve the public indifferently and where there are no reasons implicit in the
nature of the operations to expect an indifferent holding-out to the eligible user public.

10.     Because of the wide availability of common carrier circuits on existing and future
cables and satellite circuits between the U.S. Territory of Guam, the Philippines, Hong Kong,
the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea, there is no public-interest reason
to require that Orient Express's proposed cable facilities be provided on a common carrier
basis.

11.     In addition, since Orient Express will make "individualized decisions, whether and
on what terms to deal" and does not undertake to "carry for all people indifferently," there is
no reason to expect that the proposed cable circuits would be held out to the public by Orient
Express indifferently.  We thus conclude that Orient Express will not in fact offer capacity in
the Orient Express cable system to the public on a common carrier basis, and thus is not subject
to regulation under Title II of the Communications Act.

12.     In response to AT&T-SSI's comments, we reaffirm that our grant of a license for one
non common carrier cable does not in any way preclude the grant of future licenses for
potentially competing cables, whether non common carrier or common carrier.  The market,
not our economic judgment, will determine the viability of potential cables along any given
route.  As Orient Express stated, this has been the Commission's policy since Tel-Optik.

13.     Consistent with prior decisions, we find that Orient Express's statement that the
Orient Express Cable System will land in the U.S. Territory of Guam, the Philippines, Hong
Kong, the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea to be sufficient to determine
whether the proposed cable would comply with the provisions of the Cable Landing License Act
and Commission rules.  Since the time of the filing of Orient Express's application, the
Commission has reduced the amount of information required in cable landing license
applications.  Specifically, the Section 214 Streamlining Order permits applicants in their initial
applications to provide a general geographic description of the landing points.  It requires that
grant of cable landing license applications be conditioned on final approval of a specific
description of landing points no later than ninety days prior to construction.  The Commission
will give public notice of this description, and grant of the license will be considered final unless
we issue a public notice to the contrary no later than sixty days after receipt of the specific
description of the landing points.  

14.     Based on the information provided by Orient Express and pursuant to the
Commission's procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, we
conclude that the grant of the requested authorizations would not significantly affect the
environment.  Consequently, Orient Express is not required to submit an environmental
assessment, and this application is categorically excluded from environmental processing.
 
15.     Accordingly, we conclude that U.S. interests under the Cable Landing License Act
will be served by grant of the license to Orient Express, as conditioned below.

                             Ordering Clauses

16.     Consistent with the foregoing, we hereby GRANT AND ISSUE, under the provisions
