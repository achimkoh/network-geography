                     CABLE LANDING LICENSE

         Adopted:  September 23, 1996 Released:  September 25, 1996

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

        1.In this Order, we grant the application of Asia Direct Communications, L.L.C.,
(Asia Direct) under the Cable Landing License Act for authority to land and operate a digital
fiber optic submarine cable system extending between the west coast of United States and
Canada, Japan, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Korea (Asia Direct cable
system), with landing points on the west coast of the continental United States and Canada, and
in Japan, the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea, on a non-common carrier
basis.  The proposed cable would promote the public interest by providing needed additional
voice, video, and high speed data transmission capacity between and among the United States,
Canada, Japan, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Korea.  We find that Asia
Direct has provided sufficient information to comply with the Cable Landing License Act, and
therefore grant the cable landing license, subject to the conditions listed below.  

                          Application

        2.Asia Direct is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Virginia.  All of its owners and officers are U.S. citizens.  The applicant
proposes to land and operate the Asia Direct cable system as a non-common carrier system in
which capacity would be sold or leased to users on a non-tariffed, non-common carrier basis. 
The cable system would be owned by Asia Direct and entities authorized to land and operate an
international submarine fiber optic cable system in the following countries:  Canada, Japan, the
People's Republic of China and the Republic of Korea.  All of the proposed cable system's plant
and equipment located in the United States would be owned by Asia Direct.  All of the proposed
cable system's plant and equipment located in Canada, Japan, the People's Republic of China and
the Republic of Korea would be owned by entities authorized to land and operate an international
submarine fiber optic cable system in those countries.  The precise landing points of the proposed
cable system on the west coast of the continental United States, in Canada, Japan, the People's
Republic of China and the Republic of Korea have yet to be selected.  Asia Direct asserts that the
landing points will be in conformity with plans approved by the Secretary of the Army and all
necessary and appropriate agencies of the Governments of Canada, Japan, the People's Republic
of China and the Republic of Korea.  The proposed cable system is scheduled to be operational in
the fourth quarter of 1998.

        3.The proposed cable system will consist of twelve segments:  A through L. 
Segment A is located in U.S. territory.  Segment A is the cable landing station to be located on
the west coast of the United States.  Segment B is the cable landing station to be located in or
near Shanghai, People's Republic of China.  Segment C is the cable landing station to be located
in the southeastern portion of the Republic of Korea.  Segment D is the cable landing station to
be located in the southern portion of Japan.  Segment E is the cable landing station to be located
in the southwestern portion of Canada.  Segment F consists of the whole of the submarine cable
system between the system interface at Segment A and branching unit 1 (BU1).  Segment G
consists of the whole of the submarine cable system between BU1 and the system interface at
Segment E.  Segment H consists of the whole of the submarine cable system between BU1 and
branching unit 2 (BU2).  Segment I consists of the whole of the submarine cable between BU2
and the system interface at Segment D.  Segment J consists of the whole of the submarine cable
system between BU2 and branching unit 3 (BU3).  Segment K consists of the whole of the
submarine cable system between BU3 and the system interface at Segment C.  Segment L
consists of the whole of the submarine cable system between BU3 and the system interface at
Segment B.  Segments F, H and J will each have four fiber pairs with a design capacity of 1,008
MIUs per fiber pair for a total design capacity of 4,032 MIUs.  Segments K and L will each have
three fiber pairs with a design capacity of 1,008 MIUs per fiber pair for a total design capacity of
3,024 MIUs.  Segments G and I will each have two fiber pairs with a design capacity of 1,008
MIUs per fiber pair for a total design capacity of 2,016 MIUs.

        4.Asia Direct states that because it seeks to provide capacity in the proposed cable
system on a non-common carrier basis and there is no public interest reason for the Commission
to require the Asia Direct facilities to be offered on a common carrier basis, its application need
not be evaluated pursuant to Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.  Asia Direct thus urges
the Commission to consider the application only pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act.

        5.Asia Direct also states that its proposed cable will yield significant public
benefits.  The proposed cable, Asia Direct asserts, will provide needed additional international
voice, data and video telecommunications services between and among the United States,
Canada, Japan, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Korea with greater cost
efficiency than is presently available.  Asia Direct submits that the proposed cable will result in
the expansion and introduction of new and improved service offerings, including private line
services, electronic document interchange services, message services, and broadband services. 
The proposed cable system, Asia Direct submits, will interconnect with the domestic and
international interexchange telecommunications networks of the United States, Canada, Japan,
the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Korea and points beyond.  Asia Direct also
states that the proposed cable system will provide high reliability and low cost capacity,
redundancy, security and restoration for communications between and among the United States,
Canada, Japan, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Korea. 

                            Comments

        6.  The Asia Direct application was placed on public notice on December 1, 1995. 
No comments were received.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's Rules, the
Cable Landing License Act and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of
State of Asia Direct's application.  The Department of State, after coordinating with the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of Defense, stated that
it has no opposition to the grant of the cable landing license.
                                
                           Discussion

        7.  Asia Direct requests a license under the Commission's private submarine cable
policy to promote competition in the provision of international transmission facilities.  Pursuant
to this policy, the Commission has authorized non-common carrier cables where there is no legal
compulsion to serve the public indifferently and where there are no reasons, implicit in the nature
of the operations, to expect an indifferent holding out to the eligible user public.  

        8.Because of the wide availability of common carrier circuits on existing and future
cables and satellite circuits between and among the United States, Canada, Japan, the People's
Republic of China and the Republic of Korea there is no public interest reason to require that
Asia Direct's proposed cable facilities be provided on a common carrier basis.  Also, in light of
the significant demand for telecommunications facilities, we see no prospect of creating
significant overcapacity by the introduction of non-common carrier facilities, so as to threaten
the economic viability of existing common carrier cable or satellite facilities.  Thus, there is no
reason to require Asia Direct to operate the proposed systems on a common carrier basis.

        9.In addition, since Asia Direct will make "individualized decisions, whether and on
what terms to deal" and does not undertake to "carry for all people indifferently," there is no
reason to expect that the proposed cable circuits would be held out to the public by Asia Direct
indifferently.  We thus conclude that Asia Direct will not in fact offer capacity in the Asia
Direct Cable System to the public on a common carrier basis, and thus is not subject to
regulation under Title II of the Communications Act.
        
        10.Consistent with prior decisions, we find that Asia Direct's descriptions that the
proposed cable will land in the west coast of the continental United States and Canada, and in
Japan, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Korea to be sufficient to determine
whether the proposed cable would comply with the provisions of the Cable Landing License Act
and Commission rules.  In the Section 214 Streamlining Order, the Commission reduced the
amount of information required in cable landing license applications.  Specifically, the Section
214 Streamlining Order permits applicants in their initial applications to provide a general
geographic description of the landing points.  It requires that grant of cable landing license
applications be conditioned on final approval of a specific description of landing points no later
than ninety days prior to construction.  The Commission will give public notice of this
description, and grant of the license will be considered final unless we issue a public notice to the
contrary no later than sixty days after receipt of the specific description of the landing points.  

        11.Based on the information provided by Asia Direct, we conclude that the grant of 
the requested authorizations will not have a significant effect on the environment as defined in
Section 1.1307 of the Commission's rules and regulations implementing the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969.  Consequently, no environmental assessment is required to
be submitted with these applications under Section 1.1311 of the Commission's rules. 
 
        12. Accordingly, we conclude that U.S. interests under the Cable Landing License
Act will be served by grant of the license to Asia Direct, as conditioned below.

                         Ordering Clauses

        13. Consistent with the foregoing, we hereby GRANT AND ISSUE, under the
provisions of the Cable Landing License Act and Executive Order 10530, Asia Direct
Communications, L.L.C., a license to land and operate a high-capacity fiber optic digital
submarine cable (with four fiber pairs operating at a minimum 2.5 Gbps per fiber pair) extending
between the continental United States, Canada, Japan, the People's Republic of China and the
Republic of Korea, with landing points in the west coast of the continental United States and
Canada, and in Japan, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Korea.  This grant is
subject to all rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission; any treaties or
conventions relating to communications to which the United States is or may hereafter become a
party; any action by the Commission or the Congress of the United States rescinding, changing,
