CABLE LANDING LICENSE

               Adopted:  July 19, 1996         Released:  July 24, 1996

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

         1.    In this Order, we grant the application of Hawaii Express Communications, L.L.C.,
(Hawaii Express) under the Cable Landing License Act for authority to land and operate a digital
fiber optic submarine cable extending between the United States and the State of Hawaii (Hawaii
Express cable system), with landing points on the west coast of the continental United States and the
island of Oahu in Hawaii, on a non-common carrier basis.  The proposed cable would promote the
public interest by providing needed additional voice, video, and high speed data transmission capacity
between the continental United States and the State of Hawaii.  We find that Hawaii Express has
provided sufficient information to comply with the Cable Landing License Act, and therefore grant the
cable landing license, subject to the conditions listed below.  

APPLICATION   

         2.    Hawaii Express is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the
Commonwealth of Virginia.  All of its owners and officers are U.S. citizens.  The applicant proposes
to land and operate the Hawaii Express cable as a non-common carrier system in which capacity
would be sold or leased to users on a non-tariffed, non-common carrier basis.  All of the proposed
cable system's plant and equipment located in the United States would be owned by Hawaii Express. 
The entire cable system, including plant and equipment, would be owned by Hawaii Express.  The
precise landing points of the proposed cable system on the west coast of the continental United States
and the island of Oahu in Hawaii have yet to be selected.  Hawaii Express asserts that the landing
points will be in conformity with plans approved by the Secretary of the Army.  The proposed cable
system is scheduled to be operational in the second quarter of 1997.

         3.    The proposed cable system will consist of three segments:  A, B and C.  Segments A
and C are located in U.S. territory.  Segment A is the cable landing station to be located on the Island
of Oahu.  Segment C is the cable landing station to be located on the west coast of the continental
United States.  Segment B will consist of the whole of the submarine cable system between and
including the system interfaces at Segments A and C.  The minimum design capacity of the proposed
cable system between system interfaces will be 2,016 MIUs per fiber pair, for a total minimum design
capacity of 4,032 MIUs.

          4.     Hawaii Express states that because it seeks to provide capacity in the proposed cable
system on a non-common carrier basis and there is no public interest reason for the Commission to
require the Hawaii Express facilities to be offered on a common carrier basis, its application need not
be evaluated pursuant to Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.  Hawaii Express thus urges the
Commission to consider the application only pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act.
          
          5.     Hawaii Express also states that its proposed cable will yield significant public benefits. 
The proposed cable, Hawaii Express asserts, will provide needed additional international voice, data
and video telecommunications services between the continental United States and the State of Hawaii
with greater cost efficiency than is presently available.  Hawaii Express submits that the proposed
cable will result in the expansion and introduction of new and improved service offerings, including
private line services, electronic document interchange services, messaging services, and broadband
services.  Hawaii Express also states that the proposed cable, by adding capacity and restoration
capability along the United States and the Hawaii route, will enhance the quality and security of
communications between the continental United States and Hawaii. 

COMMENTS
                           
          6.     The Hawaii Express application was placed on public notice on July 14, 1996.  No
comments were received.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's Rules, the Cable Landing
License Act and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of Hawaii Express'
application.  The Department of State, after coordinating with the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration and the Department of Defense, stated that it has no opposition to the
grant of the cable landing license.

        DISCUSSION
                                                              
         7.    Hawaii Express requests a license under the Commission's private submarine cable
policy to promote competition in the provision of international transmission facilities.  Pursuant to
this policy, the Commission has authorized non-common carrier cables where there is no legal
compulsion to serve the public indifferently and where there are no reasons, implicit in the nature of
the operations, to expect an indifferent holding out to the eligible user public.  

         8.    Because of the wide availability of common carrier circuits on existing and future
cables and satellite circuits between the United States and the Hawaii, there is no public interest
reason to require that Hawaii Express' proposed cable facilities be provided on a common carrier
basis.  Also, in light of the significant demand for telecommunications facilities, we see no prospect
of creating significant overcapacity by the introduction of non-common carrier facilities, so as to
threaten the economic viability of existing common carrier cable or satellite facilities.  Thus, there is
no reason to require Hawaii Express to operate the proposed systems on a common carrier basis.

          9.     In addition, since Hawaii Express will make "individualized decisions, whether and on
what terms to deal" and do not undertake to "carry for all people indifferently," there is no reason to
expect that the proposed cable circuits would be held out to the public by Hawaii Express
indifferently.  We thus conclude that Hawaii Express will not in fact offer capacity in the Hawaii
Express cable system to the public on a common carrier basis, and thus is not subject to regulation
under Title II of the Communications Act.
          
         10.   Consistent with prior decisions, we find that Hawaii Express' descriptions that the
proposed cable will land in west coast of the continental United States and the island of Oahu in
Hawaii to be sufficient to determine whether the proposed cable would comply with the provisions of
the Cable Landing License Act and Commission rules.  In the Section 214 Streamlining Order, the
Commission reduced the amount of information required in cable landing license applications. 
Specifically, the Section 214 Streamlining Order permits applicants in their initial applications to
provide a general geographic description of the landing points.  It requires that grant of cable landing
license applications be conditioned on final approval of a specific description of landing points no later
than ninety days prior to construction.  The Commission will give public notice of this description,
and grant of the license will be considered final unless we issue a public notice to the contrary no later
than sixty days after receipt of the specific description of the landing points.  

         11.   Based on the information provided by Hawaii Express, we conclude that the grant of 
the requested authorizations will not have a significant effect on the environment as defined in Section
1.1307 of the Commission's rules and regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act
of 1969.  Consequently, no environmental assessment is required to be submitted with these
applications under Section 1.1311 of the Commission's rules. 
 
         12.   Accordingly, we conclude that U.S. interests under the Cable Landing License Act will
be served by grant of the license to Hawaii Express, as conditioned below.

                             ORDERING CLAUSES
