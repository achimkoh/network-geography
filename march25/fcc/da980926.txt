                                   ORDER


                 Adopted:  May 11, 1998                        Released:  May 19, 1998 

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                             I.  INTRODUCTION

      1.      In this Order, we deny the petition of Lambda Communications, Inc. ("Lambda") to
require Puerto Rico Telephone Company ("PRTC") to divest its interests in the corporation that
operates the Isla Verde Cable Station.  We remind PRTC and the operator of the cable landing station
that we have the right to take action to ensure the most efficient use of the relevant cables, if
necessary.    

                              II.  BACKGROUND

      2.      Lambda provides a full array of local and interstate telecommunications services in
Puerto Rico and is building a fiber optic network in Puerto Rico.  In order to provide interstate
transport and switching services to long distance or interexchange carriers, Lambda sought to locate
equipment at the Isla Verde Cable Station, a landing point in Puerto Rico for the Taino Carib Cable
and the Antillas I Cable.  Lambda's goal was to compete with PRTC, the incumbent local exchange
carrier in Puerto Rico.  The Isla Verde Cable Station is owned and operated by Telecomunicaciones
Ultramarinas de Puerto Rico ("TUPR").  TUPR is owned by the Puerto Rico Telephone Authority,
which also owns PRTC.  

      3.      On September 20, 1996, Lambda filed a petition with the Commission stating that
PRTC is using its ownership and control of TUPR to discriminatorily and anticompetitively preclude
Lambda from offering its service to long distance carriers and to deny these carriers a competitive
alternative to PRTC.  Lambda pointed to a long history commencing in January 1995 during which it
sought to collocate its equipment at the Isla Verde Cable Station.  Lambda requested the Commission
to modify the cable landing licenses for the Taino Carib Cable and Antillas I Cable to require that the
Isla Verde Cable Station not be owned or controlled by PRTC and to order PRTC to lease the
requested space to Lambda.  PRTC and TUPR filed comments on the petition, denying Lambda's
allegations of deliberate delay and obstruction.   Lambda filed a reply.  On April 14, 1997, Lambda
notified the Commission that TUPR, PRTC and Lambda had executed an agreement to lease space at
the Isla Verde Cable Station to Lambda.   Nonetheless, Lambda reiterated its request to the
Commission to modify the cable landing licenses to include a condition that the cable station must not
be owned or controlled by PRTC.

                             III.  DISCUSSION

      4.      Lambda has obtained facilities in the Isla Verde Cable Station and therefore we do not
need to consider whether the Commission should order TUPR to lease the requested space to Lambda. 
We therefore turn to whether the Commission should prohibit PRTC from owning or controlling the
Isla Verde cable landing station in order to promote competition in the interstate market. The
Submarine Cable Landing Act ("SCLA") requires the Commission to grant licenses for the operation
of submarine cables.  The SCLA authorizes the Commission to grant licenses "upon such terms as
shall be necessary to assure just and reasonable rates and service in the operation and use of cables so
licensed."  In licensing submarine cables, the Commission often imposes conditions on the cable
owner and operator.  In approving the Taino Carib Cable and the Antillas I Cable, the Commission
prohibited the licensees or their affiliates from acquiring or exercising any right for the purpose of
handling traffic to or from the United States that is denied to other carriers.  

      5.      This condition gives the Commission the right to take action to ensure non-
discriminatory access to the cable and cable landing station, where necessary.   However, we choose
not to exercise this authority at this time to order PRTC to divest its interest in TUPR or for TUPR to
divest its interest in the cable landing station.  Lambda has reached an agreement to collocate its
equipment at the cable landing station and there is no evidence in the record that Lambda has been
prevented from using its equipment or providing service to the long distance carriers as it planned.  

      6.      In addition, in a related Order, adopted today, the Bureau rejected Lambda's request
that we deny a Section 214 application from an affiliate of PRTC on the grounds that PRTC acted
anticompetitively with respect to Lambda's request for access to the Isla Verde Cable Station.  In that
Order, we noted PRTC's representation that TUPR is "pleased to provide service to Lambda and to
any other party that so requests, but in complying with such requests, TUPR will not violate any of its
other obligations to other parties."  Given this representation and the complexities of collocating
equipment in the cable landing station, we found that Lambda's arguments were not sufficient to deny
the Section 214 license.  We reiterate, though, that we retain jurisdiction over the operation of the
cable landing station through the cable landing license and we are prepared to exercise that jurisdiction
if necessary.  

                              IV.  CONCLUSION

      7.      For the reasons stated above, we deny Lambda's request to require Puerto Rico
Telephone Company to divest its interests in the corporation that operates the Isla Verde Cable Station.
