 MODIFICATION OF CABLE LANDING LICENSE AND TRANSFER OF CONTROL

   Adopted:  September 5, 2000          Released: September 6, 2000

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division, International Bureau:

                      I.Introduction
               1.   In this Order, we modify the cable landing license held by
               Transgulf Communications Ltd., Inc. (TGCL) (the Applicant) to change the
               landing point in the United States from Freeport, Texas to a new location in
               Corpus Christi, Texas, and to amend the specifications of the system described
               in the license to reflect a repeaterless system in the Gulf of Mexico.  The
               Application also requests authority to complete a nunc pro tunc pro forma
               transfer of control of TGCL.    The original license authorized TGCL, pursuant
               to the Cable Landing License Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, to land and
               operate a fiber optic submarine cable system, called the TGCL system,
               extending between the United States, Mexico, and other international locations. 
               The license subsequently was modified to reflect the transfer of control of TGCL
               to Margus Telecom International Ltd. (MTI).
2.     The Application, as amended, requests authority to change the United States cable landing
point from Freeport, Texas, to Corpus Christi, Texas.  According to the Application, the precise location
of the landing station in Corpus Christi is Latitude 27§ 35.763" N, Longitude 97§ 12.858" W.  TGCL will
maintain ownership and control over the License, and will own and control the U.S. landing stations, the
U.S. land portion of the TGCL cable from the landing stations to the U.S. beach joints of the submerged
portion of cable, and the TGCL U.S. cable landing stations' assets.  The TGCL system will continue to
be operated on a non-common carrier basis.
3.     As shown in Exhibit A, the new proposed TGCL system will festoon along the coast of the
Gulf of Mexico from Corpus Christi to Cancun, the Mexican international gateway.  The TGCL system
will be a repeaterless submarine cable design housing a total of 48 fibers.  Each fiber pair will be
equipped with 2.5 Gbps transmission equipment capable of carrying 30,720 circuits operating at 64 Kbps
each.  The total initial baseband capacity will amount to 737,280 circuits.  All transmission equipment
will be Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) ready, initially capable of transmitting 4 wavelengths
or 10 Bps per fiber pair.  The overall system capacity will be 240 Gbps or 2,949,120 circuits.  The TGCL
system will generally be a self-healing ring configuration, by complementing existing carrier's networks.
However, in certain areas of Mexico where the system segments do not complement existing structures,
the system will operate on a point-to-point basis.
4.     TGCL is an Oklahoma corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of MTI, a New Jersey
corporation, which together with its Mexican subsidiary MEXIGULF TELECOMUNICACIONES, S.A.
DE C.V. (MEXIGULF) will own and operate the TGCL system.  
                        V.Comments
6.     We placed the Application on public notice on April 19, 2000.   We received no comments. 
Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License Act, and Executive
Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the modification request.  The Department of
State, after coordinating with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the
Department of Defense, stated that it has no objection to approving the Applicant's request to change the
landing point in the United States from Freeport, Texas to a new location in Corpus Christi, Texas, and to
amend the specifications of the system described in the license to reflect a repeaterless system in the Gulf
of Mexico.
                      VII.Discussion
8.     We grant the Applicant's request to change the landing point in the United States from
Freeport, Texas to a new location in Corpus Christi, Texas.  Given the close commercial and
communications relationship between the State of Texas and Mexico, TGCL believes that the TGCL
system should have a landing site in a more developed location of Texas.  The modification would not
affect the ownership of the cable system, its status as a non-common carrier system, or control of the
landing point.  The public interest will be served by providing cost-efficient routing for carriers to meet
increasing demands for services on the U.S.-Mexico route and by reducing risks to the cable due to
offshore oil activities off the coast of Texas.  Based on these unopposed assertions, we find that grant of
the modification would serve the public interest.
9.     We grant the Applicant's request to amend the specifications of the TGCL system described
in the license to reflect a repeaterless system in the Gulf of Mexico.  The Applicant asserts that several
key factors have changed since granting the license for the TGCL system, and that the public interest
will be served by maintaining repeaterless spans below 400 km, keeping a near 6dB transmission margin
at the beginning of the life of the system, using the maximum cable fiber count currently available,
making use of WDM, and providing access to major population centers along the Mexican west coast,
including land segments to Mexico City, Villahermosa and Merida.  Based on these unopposed
assertions, we see no reason to deny the Applicant's request to amend the specifications of the TGCL
system.
10.    We also grant the Applicant's request for nunc pro tunc approval of a transfer of indirect
control of TGCL that Applicant asserts should be deemed pro forma.  For exigent business reasons, MTI
and the Margus group of companies consolidated the Margus group of operating subsidiaries into a
newly formed holding company, Margus Holdings Company (Holdings), a Delaware corporation and the
sole shareholder of MTI.  Through MTI, Holdings has 100% ownership of TGCL.  Holdings is
controlled by Mr. Auguste Dodeman, a U.S. citizen who holds a 60% interest.  In addition, William
Wall, a U.S. citizen, also holds a 10% or greater ownership interest in Holdings.  There will be no change
in the ultimate management of TGCL or MTI.  The proposed transaction has only added an additional
parent company to TGCL.  Accordingly, this transaction is similar to categories of transactions we have
deemed to be pro forma and find it is reasonable in this instance to grant the Applicant's request to
complete a nunc pro tunc transfer of indirect control of TGCL to Holdings.  However, we caution the
Applicant that our rules require prior approval of such transfers of control and urge the Applicant to plan
accordingly in the future.
                    XI.Ordering Clauses
9.     Consistent with the foregoing and pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act and Executive
Order 10530, IT IS ORDERED that the Application, File No. SCL-MOD-20000201-00006, IS
GRANTED and the TGCL cable system cable landing license is MODIFIED to (1) change the landing
point in the United States from Freeport, Texas to a new location in Corpus Christi, Texas; (2) amend the
specifications of the system described in the license to reflect a repeaterless system in the Gulf of
Mexico; and (3) approve the nunc pro tunc pro forma transfer of indirect control of Transgulf
Communications Ltd., Inc. to Margus Holdings Company.

10.    This Modification of Cable Landing License does not modify any other terms or conditions
imposed in the license.

11.    This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  0.261, and
is effective upon adoption.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106 or applications for review
under Section 1.115 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.106, 1.115, may be filed within 30 days
of the date of public notice of this Order (see 47 C.F.R.  1.4(b)(2)).
