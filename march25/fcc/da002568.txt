                     CABLE LANDING LICENSE

   Adopted:  November 8, 2000           Released: November 9, 2000

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                      I.introduction
1.In this Order, we grant the application of FLAG Pacific Limited (FLAG Pacific) pursuant to
the Cable Landing License Act and Executive Order No. 10530, for authority to land and operate a
private fiber optic submarine cable system to be called "FLAG Pacific-1," extending between the United
States and Canada, Japan, and Korea.  FLAG Pacific proposes to operate FLAG Pacific-1 on a non-
common carrier basis.  We find that FLAG Pacific has provided sufficient information under our rules to
comply with the Cable Landing License Act, and that it would serve the public interest to grant the cable
    landing license subject to the conditions set out below.
                      II.Application
3.According to the Application, FLAG Pacific is a company organized and existing under the
laws of Bermuda.  FLAG Pacific is more than 90 percent owned by FLAG Pacific Holdings Limited, a
Bermuda intermediary holding company which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FLAG Telecom
Holdings Limited (FLAG Telecom), a publicly-traded Bermuda holding company.
4.The proposed FLAG Pacific-1 cable will be a loop system consisting of undersea segments
extending from south of Tokyo, Japan to Pusan, Korea; the Aleutian Islands, Alaska; Vancouver Island,
Canada; San Francisco, California (or, alternatively, Portland, Oregon); and the Hawaiian Islands.  As
illustrated in Exhibit A, Segment N will extend north from the western coast of the United States, either
from a point near Portland, Oregon or a point south of San Francisco, California, to Vancouver Island,
Canada, to the Aleutian Islands in Alaska, and across the Pacific Ocean to Pusan, Korea, and on to a
point south of Tokyo, Japan; Segment S will extend either from a point near Portland, Oregon or a point
south of San Francisco, California to the Hawaiian Islands, and across the Pacific Ocean to a point south
of Tokyo, Japan.  The exact landing sites and the exact locations of the landing stations, including
whether FLAG Pacific-1 will land on the western shore of Oregon as opposed to south of San Francisco,
            California, have not yet been finalized.
5.FLAG Pacific-1 will use laser-generated light to transmit digital information over eight optical
fiber pairs on Segments N and S of the system.  The system will be based on synchronous digital
hierarchy and will use dense wave division multiplexing.  The system will be constructed in a self-
healing ring architecture.  The system is designed to carry voice, high-speed data, and video traffic with
capacity of 5.12 terabits per second on each of the trans-Pacific segments, which is approximately 25
times the capacity of current trans-Pacific cable technology.  FLAG Pacific-1 is expected to begin service
                 in the fourth quarter of 2001.
                        VI.Comments
7.We placed the Application on public notice on June 16, 2000.  We received no comments on
the application.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License Act,
and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the Application.  The
Department of State, after coordinating with the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration and the Department of Defense, stated that it has no objection to issuance of the cable
                        landing license.
                      VIII.Discussion
           A.Private Submarine Cable Policy
9.FLAG Pacific proposes to operate FLAG Pacific-1 as a non-common carrier submarine cable
system in which capacity will not be offered indifferently to the user public.  FLAG Pacific requests a
license under the Commission's private submarine cable policy, which is intended to promote
competition in the provision of international transmission facilities.  Pursuant to this policy, the
Commission has authorized non-common carrier cables where: (1) there is no legal compulsion to serve
the public indifferently; and (2) there are no reasons implicit in the nature of the operations to expect an
      indifferent holding-out to the eligible user public.
10.In applying the first prong of the test to submarine cable authorizations, the Commission has
stated that there will be no legal compulsion to serve the public indifferently where there is no public
interest reason to require facilities to be offered on a common carrier basis.  This public interest analysis
generally has focused on whether an applicant will be able to exercise market power because of the lack
of alternative facilities.  Where there are sufficient alternatives, the Commission has found that the public
interest does not require the licensee to offer capacity on the proposed cable on a common carrier basis,
but rather, in those circumstances, the public interest would be served by allowing a submarine cable to
           be offered on a non-common carrier basis.
11.In the Application, FLAG Pacific states that it is not affiliated with any foreign carrier with
market power in the markets where FLAG Pacific-1 will land.  In addition, FLAG Pacific asserts that
there are sufficient existing and planned cables on the route to prevent FLAG Pacific-1 from becoming a
bottleneck facility, including: (1) CANUS-1; (2) Japan-US; and (3) China-US. 
12.No one has advocated that the public interest requires FLAG Pacific-1 to be operated on a
common carrier basis.  Given the unopposed evidence on the availability of alternative cables and FLAG
Pacific's representation that none of its affiliates has market power in any of the cable's landing
countries, we find that it would not serve the public interest to impose common carrier regulation on the
operations of FLAG Pacific-1 at this time.  We note, however, that we retain the ability to impose
common carrier or common-carrier-like obligations on the operations of this or any other submarine
cable system if the public interest so requires.  Furthermore, we maintain the authority to classify
facilities as common carrier facilities subject to Title II of the Communications Act if the public interest
requires that the facilities be offered to the public indifferently.
13.Regarding the second prong of the test, we conclude that there is no reason to expect that
capacity in the proposed cable system would be held out to the public indifferently.  FLAG Pacific states
that capacity will not be sold indifferently to the user public.  Instead, capacity will be assigned pursuant
to "individualized decisions."  We therefore conclude that FLAG Pacific will operate FLAG Pacific-1
                 on a non-common carrier basis.
14.We conclude that FLAG Pacific will not offer capacity in FLAG Pacific-1 to the public on a
common carrier basis and that the public interest does not require it to do so.  Accordingly, we conclude
that it is appropriate to license FLAG Pacific-1 on a non-common carrier basis.  We also find that FLAG
Pacific will not provide a telecommunications service for a fee to such a class of users as to be
"effectively available directly to the public" and thus will not be a "telecommunications carrier" pursuant
             to the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
            A.Ownership and Landing Points
15.FLAG Pacific has provided the ownership information required by Sections 1.767(a)(6) 63.18
of the Commission's rules.  A wholly-owned subsidiary of FLAG Pacific, FLAG Pacific USA Ltd., will
own the U.S. cable stations, including real property, buildings and terminal equipment, as well as the
U.S. territorial portions of the submarine cable from the landing stations to the U.S. territorial limit.  In
Japan, either a wholly-owned subsidiary of FLAG Pacific or a wholly-owned subsidiary of FLAG
Pacific's parent FLAG Telecom, FLAG Telecom Japan Limited, will own or have the right to use the
landing station south of Tokyo, Japan and the corresponding portions of the system in Japan.  The
foreign cable stations and the portions of the submarine cable within Canadian and Korean territorial
limits will be owned by wholly-owned subsidiaries of FLAG Pacific in each country.  FLAG Pacific
itself will own the remaining portions of the FLAG Pacific-1 system.
16.The application states that FLAG Pacific-1 will land either south of San Francisco, California
or, alternatively, on the coast near Portland, Oregon, will have a system interface at the cable landing
station on the Hawaiian Islands, a regeneration point/landing station on the Aleutian Islands in Alaska,
and system interfaces at the landing stations in Canada, Japan, and Korea.  We find the applicant's
description of the likely landing points to be sufficient to determine that the proposed system complies
with the provisions of the Cable Landing License Act and Commission rules.  Section 1.767(a) of the
Commission's rules permits applicants in an initial application to provide a general description of landing
points.  The applicant, however, must file a specific description of the landing points, including a map,
no later than 90 days prior to construction at that landing point.   The Commission will give public notice
of the filing of the specific description, and grant of the license will be considered final with respect to
that landing point unless the Commission notifies the applicant to the contrary no later than 60 days after
   receipt of the specific description of the landing points.
                A.Environmental Impact
17.The Commission has found that the construction of new submarine cable systems,
individually and cumulatively, will not have a significant effect on the environment and therefore should
be expressly excluded from our procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of
1969.  Therefore, the Applicant is not required to submit an environmental assessment, and this
application is categorically excluded from environmental processing.
                     XVIII.Conclusion
19.We grant FLAG Pacific's application for authority to land and operate a non-common carrier
fiber optic submarine cable extending between the United States and Canada, Japan, and Korea, subject
                to the conditions listed below.
                    XX.Ordering Clauses
21.Consistent with the foregoing, we hereby GRANT and ISSUE FLAG Pacific a license to land
and operate a non-common carrier fiber optic submarine cable system (consisting of eight optical fiber
pairs on Segments S and N, with capacity of 5.12 terabits per second) extending between landing points
at cable stations in San Francisco, California (or, alternatively, Portland, Oregon); the Aleutian Islands,
Alaska; the Hawaiian Islands; Vancouver Island, Canada; Tokyo, Japan; and Pusan, Korea, under the
provisions of the Cable Landing License Act and Executive Order 10530.  This grant is subject to all
rules and regulations of the Commission; any treaties or conventions relating to communications to
which the United States is or may hereafter become a party; any action by the Commission or the
Congress of the United States rescinding, changing, modifying, or amending any rights accruing to any
       person hereunder; and the  following conditions:  
(1)The location of the cable system within the territorial waters of the United States, its
territories and possessions, and upon its shore shall be in conformity with plans approved
by the Secretary of the Army, and the cable shall be moved or shifted by the Licensee at its
expense upon the request of the Secretary of the Army whenever he or she considers such
course necessary in the public interest, for reasons of national defense, or for the
maintenance or improvement of harbors for navigational purposes;
(2)The Licensee shall at all times comply with any requirements of U.S. government authorities
regarding the location and concealment of the cable facilities, buildings, and apparatus for
the purpose of protecting and safeguarding the cable from injury or destruction by enemies
