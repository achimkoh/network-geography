                  MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

Adopted:  October 9, 2001               Released: October 10, 2001

By the Associate Chief, Telecommunications Division, International Bureau:

                      I.Introduction
1.     In this Order, we grant the application of Bell S.A. ("Bell") and Pirelli S.p.A. ("Pirelli")
(together, "Applicants") seeking authority to transfer control of the cable landing license interests
held by Americatel Corporation ("Americatel") in the PAN AMERICAN Cable System ("PAN
AMERICAN") from Bell to Pirelli.
                         II.Background
1.     On January 20, 1998, we granted a joint application by Americatel and numerous other
parties, pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, to land and
operate a common carrier submarine fiber optic cable system, called PAN AMERICAN, extending
between the U.S. Virgin Islands, Aruba, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Peru and Chile.
2.     Americatel, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, is
authorized to provide U.S. international service pursuant to its Section 214 authorization.  It
provides domestic interexchange service pursuant to blanket Section 214 authority and domestic
intrastate service pursuant to various state authorizations.  Americatel's ownership and voting
interests in the PAN AMERICAN cable are each 0.41633 percent. 
3.     Bell, a corporation organized under the laws of Luxembourg, is not a
telecommunications carrier.  Bell currently holds a de facto controlling 21.32 percent ownership
interest in Olivetti S.p.A. ("Olivetti"), which, in turn owns a 54.94 percent ownership interest in
Telecom Italia S.p.A. ("Telecom Italia").  Telecom Italia holds a 100 percent ownership interest in
STET International Netherlands N.V. ("STET"), which in turn holds a 54.76 percent ownership
interest in Empresa Nacional de Telecommunicaciones S.A. ("ENTEL-Chile").  ENTEL-Chile owns
a 100 percent ownership interest in ENTEL International B.V.I. Corporation ("ENTEL BVI"),
which in turn holds an 80 percent ownership interest in Americatel. 
4.     Pirelli, a corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of Italy, is principally
engaged in the manufacture and distribution of tires and of cables and systems for the
telecommunications and energy sectors.  Pirelli, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, is a leading
manufacturer of fiber optic cables.  Applicants assert that Pirelli does not provide
telecommunications services and does not own or control any providers of telecommunications
services.  Applicants state that the purpose of Pirelli's proposed acquisition is to refocus Pirelli's
strategy on telecommunications.   
5.     On July 30, 2001, Pirelli and Edizione Holding S.p.A. ("Edizione Holding") entered into
an agreement with Bell in which they agreed to purchase from Bell, Olivetti's shares and warrants
either directly or indirectly through a company jointly owned by Pirelli and Edizione Holding.  To
accomplish this transaction, on August 3, Olimpia S.r.l. ("Olimpia") was formed under the laws of
the Republic of Italy for the purpose of acquiring the Olivetti shares and warrants.  Pirelli has an
80 percent ownership interest in Olimpia, with Edizione Holding owning the remaining 20 percent.
6.     Pirelli and Edizione Holding agreed to acquire from Bell, through Olimpia, a
combination of Olivetti shares and warrants representing approximately 21.32 percent of the total
number of ordinary shares of Olivetti ("Olivetti Shares") reported outstanding as of August 9,
2001.  Pirelli and Edizione Holding also intend to transfer to Olimpia, Olivetti Shares presently
owned by them representing 3.82 percent and 1.84 percent, respectively, of the total number
Olivetti Shares reported outstanding as of August 9, 2001. 
7.     Applicants state that although Pirelli's proposed indirect ownership interest in Olivetti is
approximately 27 percent and will not result in a de jure transfer of control, Olimpia may be able to exercise
de facto control of Olivetti, of Telecom Italia and thus, of Americatel.   According to applicants, Olimpia
could exercise de facto control pursuant to a reshuffling of the Board of Directors of Olivetti, at
which time, Olimpia would place its nominees on Olivetti's Board of Directors. Applicants explain
that once Olimpia's nominees are elected to the Olivetti Board of Directors, it is anticipated that
Olivetti will take the necessary action to elect its nominees to the Telecom Italia Board of Directors. 
As a result of the transaction, assuming the election of Olimpia's nominees to the Board of
Directors of each of Olivetti and Telecom Italia as described above and subject to the provisions of
a shareholders agreement, Pirelli could potentially be considered as de facto controlling Olivetti,
Telecom Italia, and thus Americatel.  Thus, this application is being treated as an application for
transfer of control.
                        1.III.Comments
1.     We placed the Application on public notice on August 26, 2001.  We received no
comments.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License
Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the potential transfer
of control request. The Department of State, after coordinating with the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of Defense, stated that it
has no objection to approving the Applicants' request to transfer control of the cable-landing
license of Americatel from Bell to Pirelli.  
                       1.IV.Discussion
1.     Under Section 1.767(a)(8) of the Commission's rules, applicants are required to disclose
their affiliations with foreign carriers.  Pirelli has certified that it is not a foreign carrier within
the meaning of Section 63.09(d) of the Commission's rules, and that it is not affiliated within the
meaning of Section 63.09(e) with any foreign carriers.  According to the Application, Americatel is
affiliated with the following foreign carriers in Peru and Chile, landing points for PAN
AMERICAN:  TIM Peru, S.A.C. and ENTEL-Chile. Applicants assert that all destination
markets, including Peru and Chile, are WTO member countries.  Applicants further assert that
the market share in the international transport and local access markets of each of its affiliated
foreign carriers in Peru and Chile is significantly less than 50 percent.  We conclude, therefore,
that Americatel's affiliated foreign carriers do not possess market power that would allow them to
discriminate against unaffiliated U.S. carriers through control of bottleneck facilities in Peru or
Chile, and we see no reason to deny Applicants' request to transfer control of the cable landing
license of Americatel to Pirelli.
2.     We also conclude that the transfer of control of Bell's interest to Pirelli raises no
competitive concerns.   Specifically, we conclude that Pirelli's ownership of a 0.41633 percent
interest in PAN AMERICAN will not cause competitive concerns.  Additional cables serve the
route, and more are coming on line.  Moreover, the amount of ownership interest that Pirelli will
acquire in PAN AMERICAN as a result of this transfer of control is insubstantial. 
3.     Applicants assert that the proposed transfer of control will serve the public interest
because Americatel will be affiliated with an entity (Pirelli) that has the management experience,
workforce and means that will strengthen Americatel's ability to bring competitive integrated
telecommunications services to consumers in the United States.  Applicants maintain that the
proposed transfer will allow Americatel to manage its telecommunications operations more
efficiently, thereby permitting greater investment in facilities, customer service and technological
innovation.  
4.     Upon consideration of the record in this proceeding, and in view of the foregoing, we
conclude that grant of the transfer of control sought in the Application will serve the public interest
and is consistent with the Cable Landing License Act.
5.     We modify the initial authorization to reflect these transactions.  We do not modify the
initial authorization in any other respect.
                    5.Ordering Clauses
1.     Consistent with the foregoing and pursuant to the Cable Landing License
Act and Executive Order 10530, IT IS ORDERED that the Application, File No. SCL-T/C-

SCL-97-001) IS HEREBY MODIFIED to reflect those transactions.
2.     This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R. 
0.261, and is effective upon adoption.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106
