                  MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

   Adopted: September 7, 2000           Released: September 8, 2000

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division, International Bureau:

                                
                         i.Introduction
1.     In this Order, we grant the joint applications of World Access Inc. (World Access) and
STAR Telecommunications, Inc. (STAR and together "Applicants") seeking authority to transfer to
World Access control of international Section 214 authorizations, as well as interests in certain
submarine cable landing licenses held by STAR, in connection with the proposed merger of World
Access and STAR.  
                         II.BACKGROUND
2.     World Access is a publicly held Delaware corporation headquartered in Georgia.  Through
its subsidiaries, World Access is authorized to provide international long distance voice and data services
in the global telecommunications markets.   World Access's network is capable of supporting voice and
data services, including frame relay, Internet protocol, and asynchronous transfer mode services. 
3.     STAR, a publicly traded Delaware corporation headquartered in Santa Barbara, California,
has Section 214 authority to provide facilities-based and resold international and domestic
telecommunications service in the United States, Europe, and Asia.  STAR has switching facilities
throughout North America and Europe. Through either itself or its subsidiaries, STAR is authorized to
provide telecommunications services in the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, and
Canada. In addition to its Section 214 authority, STAR has an interest in several submarine cable
landing licenses.   
4.     World Access and STAR have entered into an agreement whereby World Access would
acquire STAR through the exchange of shares of stock.  Upon completion of the merger, STAR and its
subsidiaries will become subsidiaries of World Access.    Through the acquisition of STAR, World
Access will acquire control of STAR's subsidiaries AS Telecommunications, Inc., which is authorized to
provide international resale services; CEO California Telecommunications, Inc., which is authorized to
provide international facilities-based and resale services; and CEO Telecommunications, Inc., which is
authorized to provide international resale services.  In addition, World Access will acquire STAR's
interest in the following cable landing licenses: AMERICAS II, COLUMBUS-III, TAT-14, and
MAYA-1.
                         III.DISCUSSION
5.       On April 12, 2000, the Applicants submitted the above-captioned applications requesting
authority to transfer control of the international Section 214 authorizations and the various cable landing
licenses held by STAR.  We placed the applications on public notice on April 26, 2000. We received no
comments.  
6.     Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License Act,
and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the Word Access/STAR
application to transfer control of the submarine cable landing licenses from STAR to World Access. 
After coordinating with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the
Department of Defense, the Department of State stated that it has no objection to transferring control of
the submarine cable landing licenses held by STAR to World Access.
7.     Under Section 1.767(a)(8) of the Commission's rules, World Access is required to disclose
its affiliations with foreign carriers.  According to the applications, World Access is affiliated with non-
dominant foreign carriers in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany,
Guatemala, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
and the United Kingdom.  Because all of these countries are members of the World Trade Organization,
we presume that World Access' affiliations with these carriers do not pose concerns that would justify
denying these applications.   Moreover, the foreign carrier affiliates of World Access do not have
market power in their respective markets or the ability to discriminate against unaffiliated U.S. carriers
on the foreign end of routes through the control of bottleneck facilities or services.
8.     The Applicants state that approval of the transactions will serve the public interest by
providing a wider choice of services to both wholesale and retail users. Specifically, Applicants assert
that the merger will create economies of sale, cost savings, and synergies that will enable them to
compete effectively in the global communications marketplace.  We agree that approval of this
transaction will result in public interest benefits by providing customers with a broader range of services
for consumers while reducing transaction costs for end-users of submarine cable capacity.
9.      Upon consideration of the applications and in view of the foregoing, we conclude that this
transfer of control does not raise any of the concerns listed in the Cable Landing License Act, and that
consent to transfer control of STAR's interest in the above-mentioned cables to World Access will serve
the public interest, convenience and necessity.  We therefore grant Applicants' requests for authority to
transfer control of the international Section 214 authorizations held by STAR as well as the AMERICAS-
II, COLUMBUS-III, TAT-14, and MAYA-1 cable landing licenses.
10.    We conclude that grant of the application would be consistent with the Cable Landing
License Act.  We therefore consent to the transfer of control of STAR to World Access.  We modify the
initial authorizations to reflect this transfer of control. We do not modify the initial authorizations in any
other respect.

                      IV.ORDERING CLAUSES
11.    Consistent with the foregoing and pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act, Section 214 of
the Communications Act, as amended, and Executive Order 10530, IT IS ORDERED that the

control of the international Section 214 authorizations held by STAR is authorized and that the transfer
of control of the interests of STAR in the AMERICAS-II, COLUMBUS-III, TAT-14, and MAYA-I
cables is authorized.  The Cable Landing Licenses of the AMERICAS-II cable, File Nos. SCL-98-003
and SCL-98-003A; COLUMBUS-III cable, File No.  SCL-98-005; TAT-14 cable, File No. SCL-LIC-
