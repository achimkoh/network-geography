CABLE LANDING LICENSE

                  Adopted:  August 2, 1996             Released:  August 6, 1996
                                     
By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

      1.     In this Order, we grant the joint application of AT&T Corp. (AT&T), MCI
International, Inc. (MCII), The St. Thomas and San Juan Telephone Company, Inc. (STSJ), and
Telef¢nica Larga Distancia de Puerto Rico, Inc. (TLD) under the Cable Landing License Act for
authority to land and operate a digital submarine cable (the BAHAMAS II cable system) extending
between the United States Mainland and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.  We find that the Joint
Applicants have provided sufficient information to comply with the Cable Landing License Act, and
therefore grant the cable landing license, subject to the conditions below.

      2.    On March 29, 1996, the Joint Applicants filed their application.  It was placed on
public notice on April 19, 1996.  No comments were received.

      3.    Each of the Joint Applicants is a corporation.  AT&T is organized under the laws of
the State  of New York; MCII is organized under the laws of the State of Delaware; STSJ is organized
under the laws of the U.S. Virgin Islands; and TLD is organized under the laws of the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico.  Each of the Joint Applicants is a common carrier subject to the Communications Act
of 1934, as amended.  All of the principal officers of the Joint Applicants are citizens of the United
States.

      4.     The proposed BAHAMAS II Cable System will extend from a landing point at Vero
Beach, Florida to Nassau, the Bahamas, with an intermediate point at Eight Mile Rock, the Bahamas,
for the purpose of lightwave amplification.  BAHAMAS II will connect with the domestic networks in
the continental United States and the Bahamas.  The proposed cable system will consist of four
segments:  A, B, C and D.  Segments A will be located in U.S. territory and will be provided and
owned by AT&T. 

      5.     Segment A will consist of a cable station at Vero Beach, Florida.  Segment B will 
consist of a structure to house amplification equipment at Eight Mile Rock, the Bahamas.  Segment C
will consist of the cable station at Nassau, the Bahamas.  Segment D will comprise the whole of the
submarine cable linking Segments A, B and C, and consist of Subsegments D1, D2 and D3. 
Subsegment D1 will consist of five fiber pairs linking the cable station at Vero Beach with the passive
branch joint, a submerged device composed of a housing and any associated equipment to serve as a
junction point for the undersea cable.  Subsegment D2 will consist of five fiber pairs linking the
passive branch joint to the structure at Eight Mile Rock, and five fiber pairs linking back to the
passive branch joint.  Subsegment D3 will consist of five fiber pairs linking the passive branch joint to
the cable station at Nassau.
 
      6.     The Joint Applicants state that BAHAMAS II will consist of five optical fiber pairs.  
Initially, only one fiber pair will be equipped and will operate at 2.5 gigabits per second (Gbps).  The
capacity of each fiber pair will be comprised of sixteen 155 megabits per second (Mbps) Basic System
Modules (BSMs) with each BSM containing sixty-three Minimum Investment Units (MIUs), for a total
capacity, on each fiber pair, of 1008 MIUs.  For voice telephone requirements, digital circuit
multiplication equipment can be applied to derive nominally five times the original number of voice
paths.  BAHAMAS II will be connected to suitable facilities which will provide access to the domestic
networks in each country or territory.  In addition, BAHAMAS II will be extended by suitable
facilities to the terminals of other international communications systems, including other cable
terminals and satellite earth stations.  This will enable BAHAMAS II to be used for services between
and among the U.S. Mainland, the Bahamas and points beyond.

      7.     Consistent with our decisions regarding TLD's participation in the COLUMBUS II,
AMERICAS-1 and ANTILLAS cable systems, we do not require TLD to make a reciprocity showing
under the Cable Landing License Act.  Based on TLD's foreign affiliate certification, TLD does not
have any affiliates in the Bahamas, and thus we decline to require such a showing in this case.
      
      8.    Pursuant to our obligations under 47 U.S.C.  34-39, the Department of State has
been notified of this application.  After having coordinated with the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration and the Department of Defense, the Department of State stated that they
have no objection to the issuance of the cable landing license for the BAHAMAS II.

      9.    Based on the information provided by the Joint Applicants, we conclude that the grant
of the requested authorization will not have a significant effect on the environment as defined in
Section 1.1307 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations implementing the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C.  4321-4335.  Consequently, no environmental assessment is required
to be submitted with these applications under Section 1.1311 of the Commission's Rules.

      10.   We find that the proposed BAHAMAS II cable system is in the public interest. 
Therefore, we grant to the Joint Applicants a cable landing license for the BAHAMAS II cable system.

                             ORDERING CLAUSES

      11.   Consistent with the foregoing, the Commission hereby GRANTS AND ISSUES, under
the provisions of the Cable Landing License Act, 47 U.S.C.  34-39, and Executive Order 10530, 3
C.F.R.  1954-1958, to the Joint Applicants, AT&T, MCII, STSJ and TLD a license to land and
operate one high capacity digital submarine cable system between and among Vero Beach, Florida and
Nassau, the Bahamas, comprised of five optical fiber pairs, each having a capacity of sixteen 155
Mbps BSM with each BSM containing sixty-three MIUs for a total capacity, on each fiber pair, of
1008 MIUs.  This license is subject to all rules and regulations of the Federal Communications
Commission; any treaties or conventions relating to communications to which the United States is or

      expense upon the request of the Secretary of the Army whenever he or she considers such
      course necessary in the public interest, for reasons of national defense, or for the maintenance
      or improvement of harbors for navigational purposes;    

      (2) The Licensees shall at all times comply with any requirements of United States

      territories or possessions, to land, connect or operate cables or landlines, to construct or
      operate radio stations, or to interchange traffic, which is denied to any other United States
      carrier by reason of any concession, contract, understanding, or working arrangement to which
      the Licensees or any persons controlling it or controlled by it are parties;    

      (4) Neither this license nor the rights granted herein, shall be transferred, assigned, or in any
      manner either voluntarily or involuntarily disposed of or disposed of indirectly by transfer of
      control of the Licensees to any persons, unless the Federal Communications Commission shall
      give prior consent in writing;

      (5) The Licensees shall maintain 100 percent ownership in the cable stations in the United

      (6) This license is revocable after due notice and opportunity for hearing by the Commission
      in the event of breach or nonfulfillment of any requirements specified in Section 2 of "An Act

      them shall be terminated; and

      (8) The terms and conditions upon which this license is given shall be accepted by the
      Licensees by filing a letter with the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission,
      Washington, D.C. 20554, within 30 days of the release of this cable landing license.
