              MODIFICATION OF CABLE LANDING LICENSE

Adopted:  December 17, 1998                           Released: December 21, 1998  

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                         I.  Introduction

     1.    In this Order, we modify the cable landing license recently granted to fONOROLA Fiber
Development Inc. (fONOROLA Fiber) and Ledcor Industries Inc. (Ledcor).  That license authorized
fONOROLA Fiber and Ledcor, under the Cable Landing License Act, to land and operate a fiber optic
submarine cable system to be called "America-Canada-1" or "AmeriCan-1," extending between the United
States and Canada.   AmeriCan-1 will be operated on a non-common carrier basis.  We here grant the
licensees' request to modify the license to:  (1) increase the capacity of the cable system; (2) change the
ownership of AmeriCan-1; and (3) set aside the requirement that the licensees seek Commission approval
prior to the sale or transfer to a foreign entity of five percent or more in the aggregate of indirect ownership
in the licensees.

                          II.  Comments 

     2.    The application was placed on public notice on September 4, 1998.  No comments were
received.   Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License Act, and
Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the application.  The Department of
State, after coordinating with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the
Department of Defense, stated that it has no objection to issuance of the cable landing license, provided that
no party may acquire direct or indirect control of the cable system without prior approval by the
Commission.
     
     3.   The application requests that the Cable Landing License be amended as follows:

                    a.   To increase the capacity of the cable from three bundles of 12 strands each to four
          bundles of twelve strands each, for a total of 48 strands;

                    b.   To change the ownership of the cable to allow fONOROLA Fiber to own an
          undivided 62.5 percent interest in the landing stations and cable (30 of 48 strands) and to
          allow Ledcor to own the remaining 37.5 percent undivided interest in the landing stations
          and cable (18 of 48 strands); and

                    c.   To modify condition (9) of the license, which, among other things, requires prior
          approval by the Commission to sell or transfer to a foreign entity five percent or more of
          indirect ownership in the licensees.
     
                         III.  Discussion

     4.   We grant the applicants' request to increase the capacity of the cable.  If the applicants had
initially requested four bundles of twelve strands each, we would have had no reason not to grant their
request.  We also grant the applicants' request to modify the ownership of the submarine cable and cable
landing stations.  The proposed ownership structure does not alter the licensees' ability to control the cable
system.  Accordingly, we see no reason not to grant the applicants' request to modify the ownership
structure.

     5.     Finally, we grant the applicants' request to modify condition (9) of the original license. 
The applicants state that because fONOROLA's parent, Call-Net Enterprises, Inc., (Call-Net) is a publicly-
traded Canadian corporation the licensees have no control over nor ability to obtain prior Commission
approval for indirect transfers of ownership of five percent or more. 

     6.   We have not routinely imposed this restriction on indirect ownership in the past, nor did we
intend the consequences envisioned here.  We are satisfied that the remaining restrictions in the cable
landing license, as herein modified, are sufficient to protect the public interest in this case.  For example,
there can be no transfer of control of the licensees without prior Commission consent, and any change of
direct ownership of five percent or more requires prior Commission consent.  Accordingly, we remove the
words "or indirect" from the ninth condition attached to the cable landing license.  That is, we will not
require fONOROLA Fiber or Ledcor to obtain Commission approval prior to the acquisition of five
percent or more of Call-Net's shares by one or more foreign entities.  We will, however, maintain the
requirement that fONOROLA Fiber and Ledcor obtain Commission approval before the sale or transfer of
five percent or more of direct ownership of the Licensees.

                     IV.  Ordering Clauses 
                                
     7.   Consistent with the foregoing and pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act and
Executive Order 10530, IT IS ORDERED that application, File No. SCL-AMD-19980831-00015, is
GRANTED and the AmeriCan-1 landing license is MODIFIED to:  (1) increase the capacity of the cable
system to four bundles of 12 fibers each; (2) alter the ownership such that fONOROLA Fiber would own
an undivided 62.5 percent interest in the cable landing stations and the cable (30 of 48 strands) and Ledcor
would own the remaining 37.5 percent undivided interest in the cable landing stations and the cable (18 of
48 strands); and (3) set aside, in part, one condition imposed in the license granted to fONOROLA Fiber
and Ledcor to land and operate AmeriCan-1 a non-common carrier cable system, DA 98-1668. 
Specifically, we remove the words "or indirect" from the ninth condition attached to that license as
paragraph 16(9).  That condition now provides as follows:  (9) The Licensees shall, by application, obtain
Commission approval prior to the sale or transfer to a foreign entity of five percent or more in the
aggregate of direct ownership in the licensees."

     8.   This Modification of Cable Landing License does not modify any other terms or conditions
imposed in the license issued on August 21, 1998.

     9.   This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  0.261,
and is effective upon adoption.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106 or applications for review
under Section 1.115 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.106, 1.115, may be filed within 30 days of
the date of public notice of this order (see 47 C.F.R.  1.4(b)(2)).
