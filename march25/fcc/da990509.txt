Adopted:  March 15, 1999                           Released:  March 18, 1999

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                         I.  Introduction

     1.   In this Order, we grant the application of MAC Landing Corp. under the Cable Landing
License Act for authority to land and operate a private fiber optic submarine cable system to be called
"Mid-Atlantic Crossing" or "MAC," extending between the U.S. mainland and St. Croix, U.S. Virgin
Islands.  This system will be operated on a non common carrier basis.  We find that MAC Landing Corp.
has provided sufficient information under our rules to comply with the Cable Landing License Act and that
it would serve the public interest to grant the cable landing license subject to the conditions listed below. 

                        II.  Application 

     2.   MAC Landing Corp., a Delaware corporation, is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Mid-Atlantic Crossing Ltd., a Bermuda company, which, through a series of intermediate holding
companies, is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Crossing, a Bermuda company which is
majority owned by U.S. interests.  MAC Landing Corp. will own all U. Ltd.S. cable terminal equipment
and the U.S. territory portions of MAC from the landing stations to the points that are one-half mile beyond
the U.S. territorial limit.  Mid-Atlantic Crossing Ltd. will own the remaining portions of MAC.  

     3.   The proposed MAC system will connect: (1) Brookhaven, New York and Hollywood,
Florida; (2) Hollywood, Florida and St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands; and  (3) St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands
and Brookhaven, New York.  MAC will be a state-of-the-art, optically amplified fiber system, consisting of
two optical fiber pairs, one for service and one for protection, each employing wavelength division
multiplexing.  The system will be constructed in a self-healing ring architecture.  The wet plant design will
initially support 10 gigabits per second (Gbps) of capacity on each fiber pair between terminal stations for
service.  Upon completion of the system's ring configuration, the capacity will be 20 Gbps, upgradeable to
a minimum of 40 Gbps using dense wavelength division multiplexing.  

     4.   As shown in Exhibit A of the application that is attached to this order, MAC will consist
of three segments.  Segment 1 will include the whole of the submarine cable system between and including
the System Interface at the cable station in Brookhaven New York and the System Interface at the cable
station in Hollywood, Florida.  Segment 2 will include the whole of the submarine cable system between
and including the System Interface at the cable station in Hollywood, Florida and the System Interface at
the cable station in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.  Segment 3 will include the whole of the submarine cable
system between and including the System Interface at the cable station in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands and
the System Interface at the cable station in Brookhaven, New York.  The Minimum Capacity Unit (MCU)
will be an STM-1 (155 Mbps) on Segment 1.  Additionally, capacity will be available for sale at the DS-3
level (45 Mbps) on Segments 2 and 3.  Each segment is capable of supporting 64 STM-1 MCUs, or as
applicable to Segments 2 and 3, 192 DS-3 MCUs or a combination of STM-1 and DS-3 MCUs not to
exceed 10 Gbps.  The capacity of MAC will be sold or leased to users on a non-tariffed, private carriage
basis.  Operation of MAC is anticipated to begin in December 1999.

                          III.  Comments

     5.   The application was placed on public notice on November 13, 1998.  Tyco Submarine
Systems Ltd. (Tyco) filed comments in support of the application.  We received no other comments.
Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License Act, and Executive
Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the application.  The Department of State, after
coordinating with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of
Defense, stated that it has no objection to issuance of the cable landing license.

                         IV.  Discussion

     A.   Private Submarine Cable Policy

     6.   MAC Landing Corp. proposes to operate MAC as a non common carrier submarine cable
system in which capacity will not be offered indifferently to the user public.  MAC Landing Corp. requests
a license under the Commission's private submarine cable policy, which is intended to promote competition
in the provision of international transmission facilities.  Pursuant to this policy, the Commission has
authorized non common carrier cables where: (1) there is no legal compulsion to serve the public
indifferently; and (2) there are no reasons implicit in the nature of the operations to expect that the
applicant would make capacity available to the public indifferently and indiscriminately.

     7.   In applying the first prong of the test to submarine cable authorizations, the Commission
has stated that there will be no legal compulsion to serve the public indifferently where there is no public
interest reason to require facilities to be offered on a common carrier basis.  This public interest analysis
has generally focused on whether an applicant will be able to exercise market power because of the lack of
alternative facilities.  Where there are sufficient alternatives, the Commission has found that the licensee
will lack market power and will not be able to charge monopoly rates for cable capacity.  The Commission
has found that, in those circumstances, the public interest would be served by allowing a submarine cable
to be offered on a non-common carrier basis.

     8.   No one has suggested that the public interest requires MAC to be operated on a common
carrier basis.  MAC does not land in any foreign countries.  In light of the record before us, we find that it
would not serve the public interest to impose common carrier regulation on the operations of MAC at this
time.  We note, however, that we retain the authority to impose common carrier or common-carrier-like
obligations on the operations of this or any other submarine cable system if the public interest so requires. 
Furthermore, we have always maintained the authority to classify facilities as common carrier facilities
subject to Title II of the Communications Act if the public interest requires that the facilities be offered to
the public indifferently.

     9.   Regarding the second prong of the test, we conclude that there is no reason to expect that
capacity in the proposed cable system would be held out to the public indifferently.  MAC Landing Corp.
states that capacity will not be sold indifferently to the user public.  Rather, capacity will be assigned
pursuant to individualized decisions, and bulk capacity will be offered to a specific class of eligible users. 
Users of bulk capacity will be able to obtain capacity on the system on the basis of indefeasible rights of
user (IRUs) or leases of capacity.  We therefore conclude that MAC Landing Corp. will operate MAC on a
non-common carrier basis. 

     10.  We conclude that MAC Landing Corp. will not offer capacity in MAC to the public on a
common carrier basis and that the public interest does not require that they do so.  Accordingly, we
conclude that it is appropriate to license MAC on a non-common carrier basis.  We also find that the
applicant will not provide a telecommunications service for a fee to such class of users as to be "effectively
available directly to the public" and thus will not be "telecommunications carriers" under the 1996 Act.  

     B.   Ownership and Landing Points

     11.  MAC Landing Corp. has provided the ownership information required by Section
63.18(e)(6), 1.767(a)(6), and Section 63.18(h) of the Commission's rules.  MAC Landing Corp. is
ultimately controlled by Global Crossing Ltd.  MAC Landing Corp. will lease space in the building that
houses the Brookhaven cable station and will lease or own the buildings that house the St. Croix and
Hollywood cable stations.  MAC Landing Corp. will own all U.S. cable terminal equipment and the U.S.
territory portions of MAC from the landing stations to the points that are one-half mile beyond the U.S.
territorial limit.  Mid-Atlantic Crossing Ltd. will own the remaining portions of MAC.  The Applicant
states that during the pendency of the application, it will become affiliated within the meaning of Section
63.18(h)(1)(A) of the Commission's rules with  a Japanese foreign carrier, Global Access Ltd., through
Global Crossing Ltd.'s proposed minority investment in Global Access Ltd.  Global Access Ltd. is a start-
up venture that was recently granted a Japanese Type-1 Telecommunications License.  Because the
proposed cable does not land in Japan we find that this affiliation does not affect grant of the Cable
Landing License.

          12.  MAC Landing Corp. has complied with Section 1.767(a)(5) of the Commission's
rules by providing specific information on the cable landing locations: Brookhaven, New York; Hollywood,
Florida; and St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.  This license is therefore not subject to any further public
notice or Commission approval of the cable system's landing points pursuant to the procedure in Section
1.767(a)(5) of the Commission's rules.

     C.   Environmental Impact

     13.  Based on the information provided by the applicant and pursuant to the Commission's
procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, we find that action on the
present application would not significantly affect the environment according to Section 1.1307(a) or (b) of
the Commission's rules.  Therefore, pursuant to Section 1.1306 of the Commission's rules, we conclude
that grant of the requested license would not significantly affect the environment.  Consequently, MAC
Landing Corp. is not required to submit an environmental assessment, and this application is categorically
excluded from environmental processing.

                          V.  Conclusion

     14.  We grant MAC Landing Corp.'s application for authority to land and operate a non-
common carrier fiber optic submarine cable extending between the United States mainland and St. Croix,
U.S. Virgin Islands, subject to the conditions listed below.

                      VI.  Ordering Clauses
