                      CABLE LANDING LICENSE

Adopted:  September 30, 1999                           Released:  October 1, 1999

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                         I.  Introduction

     1.   In this Order, we grant the application of FLAG Atlantic Limited (FLAG Atlantic)  under
the Cable Landing License Act for authority to land and operate a private fiber optic submarine cable
system to be called "FLAG Atlantic-1," extending between the United States and the United Kingdom and
France.  This system will be operated on a non common carrier basis.  We find that FLAG Atlantic has
provided sufficient information under our rules to comply with the Cable Landing License Act and that it
would serve the public interest to grant the cable landing license subject to the conditions listed below. 

                        II.  Application 

     2.   FLAG Atlantic is a joint venture company organized and existing under the laws of
Bermuda.  Two Bermuda holding companies, FLAG Atlantic Holdings Limited (FAH) and GTS
TransAtlantic Holdings, Ltd. (GTS TransAtlantic), hold 50% of FLAG Atlantic.  FAH is a direct wholly-
owned subsidiary of FLAG Telecom Holdings Limited, a Bermuda holding company.  GTS TransAtlantic
is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Global TeleSystems Group, Inc., a publicly-traded Delaware
corporation.  

     3.   The proposed FLAG Atlantic-1 system will be a loop system consisting of three undersea
segments extending between the United States and Europe.  As illustrated in the attached Exhibit A,
Segment N will be the whole of the submarine cable system provided between and including the system
interfaces at the cable stations on the north shore of Long Island, New York and at Cornwall, England. 
Segment S will be the whole of the submarine cable system provided between and including the system
interfaces at the cable stations on the south shore of Long Island and at Brittany, France.  Segment E will
be the whole of the submarine cable system provided between and including the system interfaces at the
cable stations at Cornwall, England and Brittany, France.  The exact landing sites and the exact locations
of the landing stations have not yet been finalized.  

     4.   FLAG Atlantic-1 will use laser-generated light to transmit digital information over four
optical fiber pairs on Segments N and S of the system and over six optical fiber pairs on Segment E of the
system.  The system will be based on synchronous digital hierarchy and will use dense wave division
multiplexing.   The system will be constructed in a self-healing ring architecture.  The total capacity of the
system will be 1.28 terrabits per second, which is approximately 25 times the capacity of current trans-
Atlantic technology.   Initially, the system will have a capacity of 160 Gbps, with upgrade potential in 160
Gbps (or multiples thereof) increments as demand warrants.  FLAG Atlantic-1 is expected to be placed in
service in October 2000. 

                          III.  Comments

     5.   The International Bureau issued a public notice of the FLAG Atlantic application on
March 26, 1999.  We received no comments on the application.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the
Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License Act, and Executive Order No. 10,530, we informed the
Department of State of the application.  The Department of State, after coordinating with the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of Defense, stated that it has no
objection to issuance of the cable landing license.
                         IV.  Discussion

     A.   Private Submarine Cable Policy

     6.   FLAG Atlantic proposes to operate FLAG Atlantic-1 as a non common carrier submarine
cable system in which capacity will not be offered indifferently to the user public.  FLAG Atlantic requests
a license under the Commission's private submarine cable policy, which is intended to promote competition
in the provision of international transmission facilities.  Pursuant to this policy, the Commission has
authorized non common carrier cables where: (1) there is no legal compulsion to serve the public
indifferently; and (2) there are no reasons implicit in the nature of the operations to expect an indifferent
holding-out to the eligible user public.

     7.   In applying the first prong of the test to submarine cable authorizations, the Commission
has stated that there will be no legal compulsion to serve the public indifferently where there is no public
interest reason to require facilities to be offered on a common carrier basis.  This public interest analysis
has generally focused on whether an applicant will be able to exercise market power because of the lack of
alternative facilities.  Where there are sufficient alternatives, the Commission has found that the licensee
will lack market power and will not be able to charge monopoly rates for cable capacity.  The Commission
has found that, in those circumstances, the public interest would be served by allowing a submarine cable
to be offered on a non-common carrier basis.
     
     8.   No one has suggested that the public interest requires FLAG Atlantic-1 to be operated on a
common carrier basis.  Nor do we find that FLAG Atlantic controls any bottleneck facilities in the markets
FLAG Atlantic-1 proposes to serve.  No commenter has disputed this fact, and we find that, in light of all
the circumstances, it would not serve the public interest to impose common carrier regulation on the
operations of FLAG Atlantic-1 at this time.  We note, however, that we retain the ability to impose
common carrier or common-carrier-like obligations on the operations of this or any other submarine cable
system if the public interest so requires.  Furthermore, we maintain the authority to classify facilities as
common carrier facilities subject to Title II of the Communications Act if the public interest requires that
the facilities be offered to the public indifferently.

     9.   Regarding the second prong of the test, we conclude that there is no reason to expect that
capacity in the proposed cable system would be held out to the public indifferently.  FLAG Atlantic states
that capacity will not be sold indifferently to the user public.  Instead, capacity will be assigned pursuant to
"individualized decisions."  We therefore conclude that FLAG Atlantic will operate FLAG Atlantic-1 on a
non-common carrier basis. 

     10.  We conclude that FLAG Atlantic will not offer capacity in FLAG Atlantic-1 to the public
on a common carrier basis and that the public interest does not require that they do so.  Accordingly, we
conclude that it is appropriate to license FLAG Atlantic-1 on a non-common carrier basis.  We also find
that FLAG Atlantic will not provide a telecommunications service for a fee to such a class of users as to be
"effectively available directly to the public" and thus will not be a "telecommunications carrier" under the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.
     
     B.   Ownership and Landing Points

     11.  FLAG Atlantic has provided the ownership information required by sections  1.767(a)(6),
63.18(e)(6), and 63.18(h) of the Commission's rules.  A wholly-owned subsidiary of FLAG Atlantic,
FLAG Atlantic USA Ltd., will own the U.S. cable stations, including real property, buildings and terminal
equipment, as well as the U.S. territorial portions of the submarine cable from the landing stations to the
U.S territorial limit.  The two foreign cable stations and the portions of the submarine cable within British
and French territorial limits will be owned by wholly-owned subsidiaries of FLAG Atlantic in each
country.  FLAG Atlantic itself will own the remaining portions of the FLAG Atlantic-1 system.  

     12.  The application states that FLAG Atlantic-1 will land on both the north and south shore of
Long Island, New York; Cornwall, United Kingdom; and Brittany, France.  We find the applicant's
description of the likely landing points to be sufficient to determine that the proposed cable system complies
with the provisions of the Cable Landing License Act and Commission rules.  Section 1.767(a) of the
Commission's rules permits applicants in an initial application to provide a general description of the
landing points.  The applicant, however, must file a specific description of the landing points, including a
map, no later than 90 days prior to construction at that landing point.  The Commission will give public
notice of the filing of the specific description, and grant of the license will be considered final with respect
to that landing point unless the Commission notifies the applicant to the contrary no later than 60 days after
receipt of the specific description of the landing points.

     C.   Environmental Impact

     13.  The Commission has found that the construction of new submarine cable systems,
individually and cumulatively, will not have a significant effect on the environment and therefore should be
expressly excluded from our procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. 
Therefore, the Applicant is not required to submit an environmental assessment, and this application is
categorically excluded from environmental processing.

                          V.  Conclusion

     14.  We grant FLAG Atlantic's application for authority to land and operate a non-common
carrier fiber optic submarine cable extending between the United States and the United Kingdom and
France, subject to the conditions listed below. 
                                 
                         VI.  Ordering Clauses 

     15.  Consistent with the foregoing, we hereby GRANT AND ISSUE FLAG Atlantic a license
to land and operate a non common carrier fiber optic submarine cable system  (consisting of four optical
fiber pairs on Segments S and N and six optical fiber pairs on segment E, with 160 Gbps capacity upon
completion, and upgradeable to 1.28 terrabits per second) extending between landing points at cable
stations in Long Island, New York; Cornwall, United Kingdom; and Brittany, France, under the provisions
of the Cable Landing License Act and Executive Order 10,530.  This grant is subject to all rules and
regulations of the Commission; any treaties or conventions relating to communications to which the United
States is or may hereafter become a party; any action by the Commission or the Congress of the United
States rescinding, changing, modifying, or amending any rights accruing to any person hereunder; and the

     United States;

          (3)  The Licensee or any persons or companies controlling it, controlled by it, or under direct or
     indirect common control with it do not enjoy and shall not acquire any right to handle traffic on a
     common carrier basis to or from the United States, its territories, or its possessions unless such
     service be authorized by the Commission pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act, as
     amended;

          (4)  The Licensee or any persons or companies controlling it, controlled by it, or under direct or
     indirect common control with it shall not acquire or enjoy any right to land, connect, or operate
     submarine cables that is denied to any other United States company by reason of any concession,
     contract, understanding, or working arrangement to which the Licensee or any persons controlling
     it, controlled by it, or under direct or indirect common control with it are parties;

          (5)  Neither this license nor the rights granted herein shall be transferred, assigned, or in any
     manner either voluntarily or involuntarily disposed of or disposed of indirectly by transfer of
     control of the Licensee to any persons, unless the Commission shall give prior consent in writing;

          (6)  The Licensee shall notify the Commission in writing of the precise locations at which the cable
     will land.  Such notification with respect to any given landing location shall occur no later than
     ninety days prior to commencing construction at that landing location.  The Commission will give
     public notice of the filing of each description, and grant of this license will be considered final with
     respect to that landing location unless the Commission issues a notice to the contrary no later than
     sixty days after receipt of the specific description;

          (7)  The Commission reserves the right to require the Licensee to file an environmental assessment
     or environmental impact statement should it determine that the landing of the cable at those
     locations and construction of necessary cable landing stations would significantly affect the
     environment within the meaning of Section 1.1307 of the Commission's procedures implementing
     the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; this license is subject to modification by the
     Commission upon its review of any environmental assessment or environmental impact statement
