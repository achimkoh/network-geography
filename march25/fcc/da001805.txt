                  MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

     Adopted:  August 8, 2000           Released:  August 9, 2000

By the Associate Chief, Telecommunications Division, International Bureau:

                         I.INTRODUCTION
          
     
 1.  In this Order, we grant the application of Teleglobe USA, Inc. ("Teleglobe USA"),
OPTEL Telecommunications, Inc. ("OPTEL") (collectively, "Licensees"), and BCE, Inc.
("BCE") (collectively, "Applicants") seeking authority to transfer control of the Licensees to
BCE.  On March 30, 2000, Applicants filed the instant application pursuant to the Cable
Landing License Act, and Section 1.767 of the Commission's rules.  The Applicants agree to
comply with the dominant carrier regulations under Section 63.10(c) of the Commission's rules
with respect to common carrier cable facilities on the U.S.-Canada route.  We placed the
application on public notice on April 17, 2000.   We did not receive any comments.  For the
reasons discussed below we grant the Applicants' request. 

                         II.BACKGROUND

      1.  Teleglobe USA, a Delaware corporation, operates primarily as a facilities-based
international carrier providing voice and data, private line, and other services on a wholesale
basis to carriers in the United States and Canada.  OPTEL, a Delaware corporation, operates a
non-common carrier undersea cable system providing telecommunications capacity on a
wholesale basis to carriers in the United States.  The Licensees are both subsidiaries of
Teleglobe, Inc. (Teleglobe), which is a Canadian corporation publicly traded on the New York
and Toronto Stock Exchanges. Teleglobe USA holds cable landing licenses for the Japan-US,
Columbus III, CHINA-US, AMERICAS-II, TAT-14, and MAYA I cable systems, and OPTEL
holds a cable landing license for the CANUS-1 cable system.
      2.  BCE is a Canadian holding company which is publicly traded on the New York
Stock Exchange, and, according to the Applicants, there are no shareholders of BCE who directy
or indirectly own 10 percent or more of the equity of BCE.   BCE's investments include a  23
percent ownership of Teleglobe through Bell Canada.  BCE has an 80 percent interest in Bell
Canada, with SBC Corporation holding the other 20 percent.  Outside of the U.S. and Canada,
BCE has indirect investments in affiliates that develop and operate telecommunications systems
in various markets, primarily in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. 

      3.  BCE proposes to acquire the 77 percent of Teleglobe that it does not already own
through Bell Canada. At the conclusion of a three-step process, BCE will directly own 80 percent
of Teleglobe with the other 20 percent to be owned by Bell Canada, which is itself 80 percent
owned by BCE.  Consequently, BCE will control Teleglobe and through Teleglobe will control
the Licensees.

      4.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing
License Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the
application.  The Department of State, after coordinating with the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of Defense, has no
objection to the proposed ownership change.

                         III.DISCUSSION

      5.  Applicants argue that the proposed transaction will serve the U.S. public interest
by enhancing competition, increasing consumer choices, and stimulating service and
technological innovations without causing any undue concentration in any one market segment.
They state that the combined company will offer a full range of services and will provide
increased choice to consumers for competitively priced international telecommunications and
Internet services.  They contend that neither Teleglobe nor BCE controls any bottleneck
facilities in the United States or has market power in any U.S. market sector.  They also agree
to comply with the dominant carrier regulations under Section 63.10(c) with respect to common
carrier cable facilities on the U.S.-Canada route.  No comments were filed on the application.

      6.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(a)(8) of the Commission's rules,  BCE is required to
disclose its affiliations with foreign carriers.  According to the Application, BCE is affiliated
with foreign carriers in Canada, Colombia, India, Mexico, Venezuela, and Brazil.  Because
Canada, Colombia, India, Mexico, Venezuela, and Brazil are Members of the World Trade
Organization, it is presumed that the BCE's affiliations with these carriers do not pose any
concerns that would justify conditioning or denying this applications.  Moreover, with respect
to the carriers in Colombia, India, Mexico, Venezuela, and Brazil, the Applicants have certified
that these carriers do not have market power in their respective markets or the ability to
discriminate against unaffiliated U.S. carriers on the foreign end of routes through the control of
bottleneck facilities or services.

      7.   We conclude that grant of the application would be consistent with the Cable
Landing License Act.  We therefore consent to the transfer of control of Teleglobe and OPTEL to
BCE.  We modify the conditions of the initial authorizations to reflect this transfer of control. 
We do not modify any of the other conditions of the authorizations.

      8.  In addition to the application for the transfer of control of the cable landing
licenses, as part of BCE's planned acquisition of Teleglobe, the Applicants and their affiliates
filed a request for transfer of control of several Section 214 authorizations.  Grant of those
applications was conditioned on issuance of written Order granting transfer of cable landing
licenses.  As we are granting the transfer of control of the cable landing licenses by this Order,
the release of this Order also makes effective the grant of the transfer of control of the Section
214 authorizations.

                      IV.Ordering Clauses

      9.  In consideration of the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED that the applications, File Nos.

authorized to transfer control of Teleglobe USA Inc. and OPTEL Telecommunications, Inc. to BCE,
Inc.  The cable landing licenses set forth in Appendix A ARE MODIFIED to reflect this transfer of
control.
      10. This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R. 
0.261, and is effective upon release.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106 or
applications for review under Section 1.115 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.106, 1.115,
may be filed within 30 days of the date of public notice of this order (see 47 C.F.R.  1.4(b)(2)).
