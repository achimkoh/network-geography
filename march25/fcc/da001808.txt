Adopted:  August 8, 2000                Released:  August 8, 2000

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division, International Bureau:

                      I.Introduction

     1.   In this Order, we grant the Application of TyCom Atlantic (US) Inc. (TyCom)
under the Cable Landing License Act and Executive Order No. 10530 for authority to land and
operate a private fiber optic submarine cable system extending between the United States and the
United Kingdom (TyCom Atlantic).  This system will be operated on a non common carrier basis. 
We find that TyCom has provided sufficient information under our rules to comply with the Cable
Landing License Act and that it would serve the public interest to grant the cable landing license
subject to the conditions listed below. 

                         II.Application

     2.   According to the Application, TyCom, a Nevada corporation, is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of TyCom Networks Limited (TyCom Networks) a Bermuda company, itself a
subsidiary of Tyco International Ltd. (Tyco) also a Bermuda company.  TyCom has certified that
it is not itself a carrier nor is it affiliated with any foreign carrier.

     3.   According to the Application, the proposed cable system will be a digital fiber-optic
system consisting of four fiber pairs (with a possible upgrade to eight fiber pairs) with a minimum
design capacity of 640 Gbps per fiber pair.  The system will have a self-healing ring configuration
consisting of a northern segment and a southern segment each of which will contain four optical
fiber pairs and each of which will be capable of carrying a minimum of 64 wavelengths of traffic
with each wavelength operating at a nominal rate of 10 Gbps.  The cable will connect Wall
Township, New Jersey, and Brean, United Kingdom.
                         III.  Comments

     4    We placed the Application on public notice on March 17, 2000.  We did not receive
any comments.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing
License Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the
Application.  The Department of State, after coordinating with the National Telecommunications
and Information Administration and the Department of Defense, stated that it has no objection to
issuance of the cable landing license.
     
                          1Discussion

     A.   Private Submarine Cable Policy

     5.   TyCom proposes to operate the cable as a non common carrier submarine cable
system under which capacity will not be offered indifferently to the user public.  TyCom requests
a license under the Commission's private submarine cable policy, which is intended to promote
competition in the provision of international transmission facilities.  Pursuant to this policy, the
Commission has authorized non common carrier cables where: (1) there is no legal compulsion to
serve the public indifferently; and (2) there are no reasons implicit in the nature of the operations
to expect the applicant would make capacity available to the public indifferently and
indiscriminately.

          6.   In applying the first prong of the test to submarine cable
          authorizations, the Commission has stated that there will be no legal compulsion to
          serve the public indifferently where there is no public interest reason to require
          facilities to be offered on a common carrier basis.  This public interest analysis has
          generally focused on whether an applicant will be able to exercise market power
          because of the lack of alternative facilities.  Where there are sufficient
          alternatives, the Commission has found that the licensee will lack market power
          and will not be able to charge monopoly rates for cable capacity.  The Commission
          has found that, in those circumstances, the public interest would be served by
          allowing a submarine cable to be offered on a non-common carrier basis.
     
          7.   TyCom asserts that there are sufficient existing and planned
          facilities on the route to prevent TyCom from exercising market power in offering
          services to the public including numerous existing common carrier cables and
          existing and planned non-common carrier cables.  The cable systems cited by
          TyCom include the following cables extending between the United States and the
          United Kingdom:  (1) PTAT, (2) Gemini, (3) TAT-8, (4) TAT-9; (5) TAT 11,
          (6) TAT-12/13, (7) Atlantic Crossing-1 (AC-1), (8) FLAG Atlantic-1, (9)
          Hibernia, (10) Level 3's transatlantic cable, (11) TAT-14, and (12) PTAT. 
          PTAT, Gemini, TAT-8, TAT-9, TAT-11, TAT-12/13, and AC-1 are all operational
          cables that extend between the United States and the United Kingdom.  The FLAG
          Atlantic-1, TAT-14, Hibernia, and Level 3 cable systems have been authorized by
          the Commission, but we are not yet aware of whether or not these cables are
          operational.  In addition, TyCom has stated that it is not affiliated with any foreign
          carriers and, accordingly, does not control any bottleneck facilities in the market
          the proposed cable system will serve.

          8.   No one has advocated that the public interest requires TyCom to
          operate its cable on a common carrier basis.  Given the unopposed evidence of the
          availability of alternative cables and TyCom's representation it does not have any
          affiliate carriers with market power in the cable landing country, we find that it
          would not serve the public interest to impose common carrier regulation on the
          operations of TyCom's proposed system at this time.  We note, however, that we
          maintain the ability to impose common carrier or common-carrier-like obligations
          on the operations of this or any other submarine cable system if the public interest
          so requires.  Furthermore, we have always maintained the authority to classify
          facilities as common carrier facilities subject to Title II of the Communications Act
          if the public interest requires that the facilities be offered to the public
          indifferently.

          9.   Regarding the second prong of the test, we conclude that there is no
          reason to expect that capacity in the proposed cable system would be held out to the
          public indifferently.  TyCom states that capacity will not be sold indifferently to the
          user public.  Instead, capacity will be assigned pursuant to "individualized
          decisions."  We therefore conclude that TyCom intends to operate the cable
          system on a non-common carrier basis.

          10.  We conclude that TyCom will not offer capacity in the TyCom
          Atlantic system to the public on a common carrier basis and that the public interest
          does not require that they do so.  Accordingly, we conclude that it is appropriate to
          license the TyCom Atlantic system on a non-common carrier basis.  We also find
          that TyCom will not provide a telecommunications service for a fee to such a class
          of users as to be "effectively available directly to the public" and thus will not be a
          "telecommunications carrier" under the Telecommunications Act of 1996.


     B.   Ownership and Landing Points

     11.  TyCom has provided the ownership information required by Section 1.767(a)(6)
and Section 63.18 of the Commission's rules.  The Applicant will own the United States landing
site as well as the wet portion of the cable within U.S. territorial waters.  The wet portion of the
cable in international waters will be owned by TyCom Networks.  The United Kingdom landing
site as well as the wet portion of the cable within the territorial waters of the United Kingdom will
be owned or otherwise controlled by a wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary of TyCom Networks.
     

     12.  The Application states that the TyCom Atlantic cable landing station in the United
States will be located in Wall Township, New Jersey at coordinates 47 degrees 08.00' north, 74
degrees 03.00' west.  In the United Kingdom, the cable landing station will be located in Brean,
U.K. at coordinates 51 degrees 15.500' north, 2 degrees 57.800' west.  Maps of both cable landing
sites are included with the Application.  

          C.   Environmental Impact

     13.  The Commission has found that the construction of new submarine cable systems,
individually and cumulatively, will not have a significant effect on the environment and therefore
should be expressly excluded from our procedures implementing the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969.  Therefore, the Applicant is not required to submit an environmental
assessment, and this Application is categorically excluded from environmental processing.

                         V.  Conclusion

     14.  We grant TyCom's Application for authority to land and operate a non-common
carrier fiber optic submarine cable extending between the United States and the United Kingdom,
subject to the conditions listed below. 

                       1Ordering Clauses

     15.  Consistent with the foregoing, we hereby GRANT AND ISSUE TyCom a license to
land and operate a non common carrier fiber optic submarine cable system (consisting of four
fiber pairs (with a possible upgrade to eight fiber pairs) extending between landing points at cable
stations at Wall Township, New Jersey and Brean, United Kingdom) under the provisions of the
Cable Landing License Act and Executive Order 10530.  This grant is subject to all rules and
regulations of the Commission; any treaties or conventions relating to communications to which
the United States is or may hereafter become a party; any action by the Commission or the
