                           CABLE LANDING LICENSE

Adopted:  January 15, 1998                             Released:  January 20, 1998

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                             I.  Introduction

        1.  In this Order, we grant the joint application of Americatel Corp. (Americatel), AT&T
Corp. (AT&T), Communications Telesystems International dba World X Change (CTS), DOMTEL
Communications, Inc. (DOMTEL), MCI International Inc. (MCII), Pacific Gateway Exchange (PGE),
Sprint Communications Company, Limited Partnership (Sprint), the St. Thomas and San Juan
Telephone Company, Inc. (STSJ), and WorldCom, Inc. (WorldCom) under the Cable Landing
License Act for authority to land and operate a digital submarine cable system to be called the PAN
AMERICAN Cable System (PAN AMERICAN) extending between the U.S. Virgin Islands, Aruba,
Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Peru and Chile.  The cable will be operated on a common
carrier basis.  We find that the Joint Applicants have provided sufficient information under our rules
to comply with the Cable Landing License Act and therefore grant the cable landing license subject to
the conditions listed below.

                             II.  Application

        2.   Americatel, DOMTEL, MCII, PGE and WorldCom are corporations organized under the
laws of Delaware.  AT&T is a corporation organized under the laws of New York. CTS is a
corporation organized under the laws of California.  STSJ is a corporation organized under the laws
of the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Sprint is a limited partnership organized under the laws of Delaware. 
Each of the Joint Applicants is a common carrier subject to the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended.

        3.  The Joint Applicants propose to land and operate PAN AMERICAN as a common carrier
system owned by the Joint Applicants and by entities authorized to land and operate an international
submarine fiber optic cable system in Aruba, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Peru and
Chile. The proposed PAN AMERICAN system will extend between landing points at cable stations in
St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands; St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands; Baby Beach, Aruba; Punto Fijo,
Venezuela; Barranquilla, Colombia; Colon, Panama; Panama City, Panama; Punta Carnero, Ecuador;
Lurin, Peru; and Arica, Chile and will be connected with the domestic networks in those countries or
territories.  The Joint Applicants expect to activate PAN AMERICAN by August 31, 1998.

        4.  PAN AMERICAN will consist of two working optical fiber pairs operating at 2.5 gigabits
per second (Gbps) per pair.  Each fiber pair will have a capacity of sixteen 155 megabits per second
(Mbits) Basic System Modules (BSM), with each BSM containing 63 Minimum Investment Units
(MIUs), for a total capacity, on each fiber pair, of 1008 MIUs.  In addition, digital circuit
multiplication equipment will be applied to derive nominally five times the original number of voice
paths for voice telephone requirements.  

        5.  PAN AMERICAN consists of Rings, Segments, and Subsegments.  Segment S will
consist of two fiber pairs per Subsegment and include the whole of the submarine cable and associated
equipment.  Ring 1 will include the following: Segment A, a cable station in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin
Islands; Subsegment SA, a submarine cable including the cable interfaces at Segments A and B; and
Segment B-1, a cable station in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.
        
        6.  Ring 2 will include the following:  Segment B-2, a cable station in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin
Islands; Subsegment S1, a submarine cable linking Segment B-2 to Branching Unit-1 (BU1);
Subsegment S2, a submarine cable linking Segment C, a cable station in Baby Beach, Aruba, to BU1;
Subsegment S3, a submarine cable linking BU1 to BU2; Subsegment S4, a submarine cable linking
Segment D,  a cable station in Punto Fijo, Venezuela, to BU2; Subsegment S5, a submarine cable
linking BU2 to BU3; Subsegment S6, a submarine cable linking Segment E, a cable station in
Barranquilla, Colombia, to BU3; and Subsegment S7a, a submarine cable linking subsegment F7-1, a
structure in Colon, Panama, to BU3. 

        7.  Ring 3 will include the following: Subsegment S7b, two contiguously integrated terrestrial
fiber pairs linking Subsegment F7-2, a structure located in Colon, Panama, and Segment G-1, a cable
station located in Panama City, Panama.

        8.  Ring 4 will include the following: Subsegment S8, a submarine cable linking Segment G-
2, a cable station in Panama City, Panama, to BU4; Subsegment S9, a submarine cable linking
Segment H, a cable station location in Punta Carnero, Ecuador, to BU4; Subsegment S10, a
submarine cable linking BU4 to BU5; Subsegment S11, a submarine cable linking Segment I, a cable
station in Lurin, Peru, to BU5; Subsegment S12, a submarine cable linking Segments J and K, both
cable stations in Arica, Chile, to BU5; Subsegment S12a, a submarine cable linking BU5 to the
Bifurcation Manhole (BM); Subsegment S12b, a terrestrial fiber optic cable, linking the BM to
Segment J; Subsegment S12c, a terrestrial fiber optic cable, linking BM to Segment K; and
Subsegment S12d, a terrestrial fiber optic cable linking Segment J to Segment K.

                              III.  Comments

        9.  The PAN AMERICAN joint application was placed on public notice on April 25, 1997. 
No comments were received.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable
Landing License Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the
application.  The Department of State advised the Commission that it has no objection to the issuance
of the cable landing license.

                              IV.  Discussion

        10.  As required by the Commission's rules, the Joint Applicants have all certified that they
have not agreed and will not agree to accept special concessions from any foreign carrier.  The Joint
Applicants further certify that any affiliated foreign carriers do not have market power or the ability
to discriminate against unaffiliated carriers through control of bottleneck services and facilities. 
MCII notes that British Telecom, a corporation organized under the laws of England and Wales, owns
twenty percent of its issued and outstanding Class A common stock.  DOMTEL and Americatel are
affiliated with carriers in the Dominican Republic and Chile, respectively.  Based on their application,
however, the Joint Applicants' foreign affiliations do not raise concerns that could persuade us to
deny the application under Section 2 of the Cable Landing License Act.  The only applicant with an
affiliated carrier served by this cable is Americatel, which is affiliated with Entel-Chile.  We have
previously found that Entel-Chile has no control over bottleneck services or facilities that can be used
to discriminate against unaffiliated U.S. carriers terminating traffic in Chile.  The other applicants'
affiliations are not on any of the routes served by this cable system.  Therefore, ownership in this
cable system does not give them the ability to discriminate against unaffiliated U.S. carriers.

        11.  PAN AMERICAN will have two landing points in the United States:  in St. Thomas,
U.S. Virgin Islands, and St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.  Both of those U.S. landing points will be
the same as those of the St. Thomas-St. Croix Cable System and are a matter of public record.  We
find that the application's descriptions of PAN AMERICAN's landing points are sufficient to satisfy
the requirement of Section 1.767(a)(5) of the Commission's rules.

        12.  Based on the information provided by the Joint Applicants and pursuant to the
Commission's procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, we
conclude that the grant of the requested authorization would not significantly affect the environment. 
Consequently, the Joint Applicants are not required to submit an environmental assessment, and this
application is categorically excluded from environmental processing.

        13.  Accordingly, we conclude that U.S. interests under the Cable License Landing Act will
be served by grant of the license to the Joint Applicants to land and operate PAN AMERICAN, as
conditioned below.
        
                           V.  Ordering Clauses

        14.  Consistent with the foregoing, we hereby GRANT AND ISSUE the Joint Applicants a
license to land and operate an optical fiber submarine cable system (consisting of two working fiber
pairs operating at 2.5 Gbps per pair) extending between landing points at cable stations in St.
Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands; St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands; Baby Beach, Aruba; Punto Fijo,
Venezuela; Barranquilla, Colombia; Colon, Panama; Panama City, Panama; Punta Carnero, Ecuador;
Lurin, Peru; and Arica, Chile under the provisions of the Cable Landing License Act and Executive
Order 10530.  This grant is subject to all rules and regulations of the Federal Communications
Commission; any treaties or conventions relating to communications to which the United States is or
may hereafter become a party; any action by the Commission or the Congress of the United States
rescinding, changing, modifying or amending any rights accruing to any person hereunder; and the
following conditions:

                (1) The location of the cable system within the territorial waters of the United States
                of America, its territories and possessions, and upon its shore shall be in conformity
                with plans approved by the Secretary of the Army, and the cables shall be moved or
                shifted by the Licensees at their expense upon the request of the Secretary of the
                Army, whenever he or she considers such course necessary  in the public interest, for
                reasons of national defense, or for the maintenance or improvement of harbors for
                navigational purposes; 

                (2) The Licensees shall at all times comply with any requirements of United States
                government authorities regarding the location and concealment of the cable facilities,
                buildings, and apparatus for the purpose of protecting and safeguarding the cables
                from injury or destruction by enemies of the United States of America; 

                (3) The Licensees or any persons or companies controlling them, controlled by them,
                or under direct or indirect common control with them do not enjoy and shall not
                acquire any right to handle traffic to or from the United States, its territories, or its
                possessions unless such service be authorized by the Commission pursuant to Section
                214 of the Communications Act, as amended;

                (4) The Licensees or any persons or companies controlling them, controlled by them,
                or under direct or indirect common control with them shall not acquire or enjoy any
                right for the purpose of handling or interchanging traffic to or from the United States,
                its territories, or its possessions to land, connect, or operate cables or landlines, to
                construct or operate radio stations, or to interchange traffic that is denied to any other
                United States company by reason of any concession, contract, understanding, or
                working arrangement to which the Licensees or any persons controlling them,
                controlled by them, or under direct or indirect common control with them are parties;

                (5) Neither this license nor the rights granted herein shall be transferred, assigned, or
                in any manner either voluntarily or involuntarily disposed of or disposed of indirectly
                by transfer of control of the Licensees to any persons, unless the Federal
                Communications Commission shall give prior consent in writing;

                (6) The Commission reserves the right to require the Licensees to file an
                environmental assessment or environmental impact statement should it determine that
                the landing of the cables at those locations and construction of necessary cable landing
                stations would significantly affect the environment within the meaning of Section
                1.1307 of the Commission's procedures implementing the National Environmental
                Policy Act of 1969; this license is subject to modification by the Commission upon its
                review of any environmental assessment or environmental impact statement that it may
                require pursuant to its rules;

                (7) The Licensees shall maintain 100-percent ownership in the cable stations in the
                United States and in the U.S. land portion of the cables from the stations to the U.S.
                beach joint of the submerged portion of the cables;  

                (8) This license is revocable by the Commission after due notice and opportunity for
                hearing pursuant to section 2 of "An Act Relating to the Landing and Operation of
                Submarine Cables in the United States," 47 U.S.C.  35, or for failure to comply
                with the terms of the authorizations;

                (9) The Licensees shall notify the Commission in writing of the date on which the
                cable is placed in service, and this license shall expire 25 years from such date, unless
                renewed or extended upon proper application, and, upon expiration of this license, all
                rights granted under it shall be terminated; and

                (10) The terms and conditions upon which this license is given shall be accepted by
                the Licensees by filing a letter with the Secretary, Federal Communications
                Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554 within 30 days of the release of the cable
                landing license.

        15.  This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  0.261,
