MEMORANDUM OPINION, ORDER AND AUTHORIZATI      ON

                Adopted:  May 11, 1998                                Released:  May 15, 1998

                By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                              I. Introduction

        1.  In this Order, we grant the application of Telef¢nica Larga Distancia de Puerto Rico, Inc.
(TLD) for authority pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47
U.S.C.  214, to (1) construct, acquire, and operate capacity in a digital submarine cable system, the
PAN AMERICAN Cable System (PAN AMERICAN), between the U.S. Virgin Islands, Aruba,
Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Peru and Chile; (2) acquire ownership in two fiber pairs, to
be included in PAN AMERICAN, from the owner of the St. Thomas   St. Croix Cable System; (3)
acquire by lease or other comparable means extension facilities as may be required to extend the
capacity of PAN AMERICAN; and (4) activate capacity in PAN AMERICAN and in the
aforementioned facilities for the provision of services already authorized by the Commission.  We
classify TLD as a dominant carrier in its provision of services to Peru, Chile, and Argentina.  Finally,
we condition TLD's authorization to use these facilities for service to Peru, Chile, and Argentina upon
TLD's affiliates' offering U.S. carriers settlement rates at or below the relevant benchmark.

        2.  TLD filed this application on October 21, 1997.  The application was placed on public
notice on November 5, 1997.  AT&T Corp. (AT&T) filed a Petition to Deny, arguing that TLD has
not demonstrated that Peru, Chile, and Argentina offer U.S. carriers effective competitive opportunities
(ECO).  As detailed below, we deny AT&T's petition and find that TLD has provided sufficient
information to comply with Section 214 of the Communications Act and that the authorization would
serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity.  Therefore, we grant TLD authority to construct,
acquire, and operate capacity in PAN AMERICAN, subject to the conditions below.

                              II. Application

        3.  TLD, a corporation organized under the laws of Puerto Rico, is a common carrier subject
to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.  On January 20, 1998, we released a cable landing
license (DA 98-81) and an order (DA 98-82) granting nine parties the same authority that TLD
requests here with respect to the PAN AMERICAN cable system.

        4.  TLD proposes to land and operate PAN AMERICAN as a common carrier system
extending between landing points at cable stations in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands; St. Croix, U.S.
Virgin Islands; Baby Beach, Aruba; Punto Fijo, Venezuela; Barranquilla, Colombia; Colon, Panama;
Panama City, Panama; Punta Carnero, Ecuador; Lurin, Peru; and Arica, Chile.  The cable system will
be connected with the domestic networks in those countries or territories.  Shareholder voting interest
in PAN AMERICAN will be divided among several parties as provided in the PAN AMERICAN
construction and maintenance agreement.  The licensees expect to activate PAN AMERICAN by
August 31, 1998.

      5.  TLD plans to use PAN AMERICAN in providing its authorized services.  TLD states that
other carriers, including non-owners, may acquire capacity in PAN AMERICAN by lease, IRU, or
other arrangements.  The minimum investment unit (MIU) assignments for each segment and
subsegment of PAN AMERICAN are included in the attachments to DA 98-82.  TLD proposes to
acquire 48 half-MIUs in PAN AMERICAN, for an ownership interest of 1.04882 percent.

      6.  TLD states that the facilities covered by this application will be used to supplement its
existing cable and satellite facilities.  Its existing satellite facilities are satellite circuits between U.S.
earth stations and the INTELSAT Atlantic Ocean Region satellites acquired from the COMSAT
Corporation pursuant to COMSAT's applicable tariffs.  Those circuits are used in conjunction with
connecting circuits between the satellites and foreign earth stations provided by TLD's foreign
correspondents or, in some instances, other telecommunications entities.  TLD's existing submarine
cable facilities used to provide service between the United States and some of those locations proposed
to be served by PAN AMERICAN consist of circuits in AMERICAS-1 and TCS-1.

                              III. Discussion

      7.  TLD certifies that it is affiliated with foreign carriers in Spain, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and
Romania.  It is therefore affiliated with foreign carriers in three countries where PAN AMERICAN
will land   Argentina, Chile, and Peru.  We evaluate this application under the policies adopted by
the Commission in its recent Foreign Participation Order.  There, the Commission adopted an open
entry policy for international Section 214 applicants affiliated with carriers from WTO member
countries.

      8.  In the Foreign Participation Order, the Commission adopted a rebuttable presumption that
applications for Section 214 authority to serve WTO member countries do not pose concerns that
would justify denial of an application on competition grounds.  In adopting the presumption, the
Commission found that it could rely on its competitive safeguards instead of an ECO analysis to
address concerns of anticompetitive behavior by a foreign carrier with market power.  Thus, we will
expeditiously grant the Section 214 application of any carrier seeking to serve WTO member countries
except in the exceptional case where a carrier's entry presents a very high risk to competition in the
U.S. market that cannot be addressed by the Commission's safeguards or by additional conditions.  In
addition, we may further review applications if the Executive Branch raises serious concerns regarding
national security, law enforcement, foreign policy, or trade issues.

      9.  Because Argentina, Chile, and Peru are members of the WTO, we presume that there is no
competition-based reason to deny TLD's application.  AT&T's petition to deny, filed before the
Foreign Participation Order became effective, argues that Peru, Chile, and Argentina fail to satisfy the
ECO test.  AT&T has not, however, demonstrated that TLD's entry into the U.S. market and
provision of service to those markets raises a very high risk to competition that cannot be addressed by
our safeguards or additional conditions.  In particular, AT&T has not made the required showing that
the Commission's safeguards would be ineffective at preventing anticompetitive conduct by TLD and
that as a result TLD would be able to raise the costs of unaffiliated U.S. carriers to the degree that
end-user customers would be injured.

      10.  TLD has made no attempt to demonstrate that its affiliates in Peru, Chile, and Argentina
lack sufficient market power to affect competition adversely in the U.S. market.  Thus, TLD will be
regulated as a dominant carrier pursuant to Section 63.10 of the Commission's rules along those
routes.  TLD may later petition for reclassification as a non-dominant carrier along any of those routes
by showing that its affiliate lacks sufficient market power to affect competition adversely in the U.S.
market.  Furthermore, as required by the Commission's rules, the TLD has certified that it has not
agreed and will not agree to accept special concessions from any foreign carrier.

      11.  Section 214 of the Communications Act requires the Commission to determine that the
authorization of the PAN AMERICAN facilities will serve the public interest, convenience and
necessity.  The proposed Section 214 authorization will improve the telecommunications
infrastructure and enhance services on the routes served by PAN AMERICAN.  The Commission has
previously stressed the importance of making advanced telecommunications available to further
economic development of the Caribbean region.  The improvement in telecommunications systems
would also improve services to areas in South and Central America.  TLD has also stated that other
carriers, including non-owners, may acquire capacity in PAN AMERICAN, so the pro-competitive
goals of the Commission are met by granting the Section 214 authorization.

      12.  Accordingly, we conclude that the public interest will be served by granting TLD
authority to construct, acquire and operate capacity in PAN AMERICAN.  Therefore, IT IS HEREBY
CERTIFIED that the present and future public convenience and necessity require a grant of the
application, as conditioned below.

                           IV. Ordering Clauses

      13.  IT IS ORDERED that application File No. ITC-97-221 IS GRANTED and Telef¢nica
Larga Distancia de Puerto Rico, Inc., is authorized, pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications
Act, as amended, to (1) construct, acquire, and operate capacity in a digital submarine cable system
known as the PAN AMERICAN Cable System between the U.S. Virgin Islands, Aruba, Venezuela,
Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Peru and Chile in accordance with the interests indicated in the
Attachments; (2) acquire ownership in two fiber pairs, to be included in PAN AMERICAN, from the
owner of the St. Thomas   St. Croix Cable System; (3) acquire by lease or other comparable means
such extension facilities as may be required to extend the capacity of PAN AMERICAN; and (4)
activate capacity in PAN AMERICAN and in its facilities for the provision of TLD's authorized
services. 

      14.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that TLD's tariffs must state that its customers may not
resell international private lines or connect them to the public switched network for the provision of
international basic telecommunications services unless authorized to do so by the Commission upon a
country-specific finding that the Commission will permit the provision of switched services over
private lines between the United States and that country.  See Market Entry and Regulation of Foreign-
Affiliated Entities, Report and Order, 11 FCC Rcd 3873 (1995); Rules and Policies on Foreign
Participation in the U.S. Telecommunications Market, Report and Order and Order on
Reconsideration, 12 FCC Rcd 23,891 (1997).  The limitations in this paragraph are subject to the
exceptions contained in Section 63.18(e)(4)(ii) of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R. 63.18(e)(4)(ii)
(1997).

      15.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the licensees of PAN AMERICAN shall make available
half-interests in PAN AMERICAN capacity to such present and future U.S. carriers as may be
authorized by the Commission to acquire such capacity.

      16.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Commission retains jurisdiction to reallocate U.S.
carriers' interests in capacity herein authorized, as the public interest may require and with any
requisite concurrence of the foreign administration or carriers concerned, in order to accommodate
additional carriers or for other reasons.

      17.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that TLD shall comply with Sections 43.82, 63.19, and
63.21 and with all other relevant Commission rules and policies.

      18.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that TLD's authorization to provide facilities-based service
to Peru, Chile, and Argentina is subject to the conditions specified in International Settlement Rates,
Report and Order, 12 FCC Rcd 19,806 (1997), that is, TLD may provide facilities-based service to a
region served by an affiliate that terminates U.S. international switched traffic only if that affiliate has
in effect a settlement rate with U.S. international carriers that is at or below the Commission's relevant
benchmark.  See id.  231.

      19.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that TLD shall be regulated as a dominant carrier under
Section 63.10 of the rules and shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of that section for
services between the United States and Peru, Chile, and Argentina.

      20.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that AT&T's Petition to Deny is DENIED.

      21.  This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  0.261,
and is effective upon adoption.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106 or applications for
review under Section 1.115 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.106, 1.115, may be filed within
30 days of the date of public notice of this order (see 47 C.F.R.  1.4(b)(2)).
