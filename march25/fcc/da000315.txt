                 THIRD MODIFICATION OF CABLE LANDING LICENSE

Adopted: February 17, 2000                     Released:  February 18, 2000  

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                             I.  Introduction

     1.    In this Order, we modify the cable landing license held by fONOROLA Fiber Development
Inc. (fONOROLA Fiber), Ledcor Industries, Inc. (Ledcor) and Fiberco Telecommunications Corporation
(Fiberco) to add MetroNet Fiber US, Inc. (MetroNet) as a fourth licensee.  The original license authorized
fONOROLA Fiber and Ledcor to land and operate a fiber optic submarine cable system between the United
States and Canada called America-Canada-1
(AmeriCan-1).  The license was later amended to add Fiberco as a third licensee.  Pursuant to the modified
license, AmeriCan-1 will continue to be operated on a non-common carrier basis.

                              II.  Comments 

     2.   On September 1, 1999, MetroNet filed an Application seeking to modify the existing cable
landing license held by fONOROLA, Ledcor and Fiberco to add MetroNet as a fourth licensee for the U.S.
portion of the cable.  We placed the Application on public notice on September 17, 1999.  We received no
comments.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License Act, and
Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the Application.  After coordinating with
the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of Defense, the
Department of State stated that it has no objection to amending the cable landing license, which was initially
granted on August 19, 1998.
     
                        III.  Discussion
     
     3.   MetroNet requests the modification in order to purchase a portion of AmeriCan-1,
including one of the four fiber bundles and an undivided interest in certain support structures including
cable landing stations in the United States.

     4.   We find that the proposed modification is in the public interest.  MetroNet, a Delaware
corporation, is a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T Canada Telecom Services Company (AT&T Canada),
a corporation organized under the laws of Canada.  Because Canada is a Member of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), we presume that the addition of MetroNet as a licensee does not raise concerns that
would justify denial of its application on competition grounds.  Indeed, as the application states, the
addition of MetroNet to the instant license will further expand facilities-based competition for services
between the United States and Canada.  Accordingly, we grant MetroNet's request to be added as a fourth
licensee of AmeriCan-1.

                     IV.  Ordering Clauses
                                
     5.   Consistent with the foregoing and pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act and
Executive Order 10530, IT IS ORDERED that application File No. SCL-MOD-19990901-00016, IS
GRANTED and the AmeriCan-1 landing license is MODIFIED to add MetroNet as a licensee of
AmeriCan-1.

     6.   This Modification of Cable Landing License does not modify any other terms or conditions
imposed in the license released on August 21, 1998.

     7.   This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  0.261, and
is effective upon adoption.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106 or applications for review
under Section 1.115 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.106, 1.115, may be filed within 30 days of
the date of public notice of this order.
