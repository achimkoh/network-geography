CABLE LANDING LICENSE
             
                            Adopted:  February 11, 1998                      Released:  February 13, 1998

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                             I.  Introduction

        1.      In this Cable Landing License, we grant the application of MFS International,
Inc. (MFSI) under the Cable Landing License Act for authority to land and operate a fiber
optic submarine cable system to be called the Southern Cross cable system (Southern Cross)
extending between the United States mainland (and Hawaii), Australia, and New Zealand. 
The cable will be operated on a common carrier basis.  We find that MFSI has provided
sufficient information under our rules to comply with the Cable Landing License Act and
therefore grant the cable landing license subject to the conditions discussed below. 

                      II.  Application and Pleadings

        2.      MFSI, a Delaware corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MFS Network
Technologies, Inc. (MFSNT), a Delaware corporation.  MFSNT is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of MFS Communications Company, Inc., (MFSCCI), a Delaware corporation. 
MFSCCI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of WorldCom, Inc., a Georgia corporation.

        3.      MFSI proposes to land and operate Southern Cross as a common carrier
system owned by MFSI and by entities authorized to land and operate an international fiber
optic cable system in Australia and New Zealand.  The proposed Southern Cross will extend
between landing points on the U.S. mainland (California), Hawaii, Australia, and New
Zealand.  Original ownership interests with equity and voting ownership in the facilities will
be available to any authorized common carrier willing to purchase interests before the closing
date for receipt of project financing.  Once that closing occurs, authorized common carriers
will be permitted to acquire capacity on an Indefeasible Right of Use (IRU) basis.  MFSI
will own 100 percent of both U.S. mainland landing station facilities.  Southern Cross is
scheduled to go into initial service in mid-1999.

        4.      Southern Cross is planned as a ring system with three main traffic loops.  The
planned capacity for the Northern Ring (U.S. Mainland to Hawaii traffic) is 50 Gigabits per
second (Gbps).  The planned capacity for the Southern Ring (Australia/New Zealand traffic)
is 10 Gbps.  The planned capacity for the North South Ring (U.S. Mainland/Hawaii to
Australia/New Zealand traffic) is 30 Gbps.  It is expected that the minimum design capacity
for any segment would be 2.5 Gbps per fiber pair.  The system is expected to be Wavelength
Division Multiplex (WDM)-capable.  
  
                             III.  Discussion

        5.      The Southern Cross application was placed on public notice on October 24,
1997.  No comments were received.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's
rules, the Cable Landing License Act, and Executive Order 10530, we informed the
Department of State of the application.  The Department of State, after coordinating with the
Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration
and the Department of Defense, stated it approves the granting of the cable landing license to
MFSI.   
        6.      As required by the Commission's rules, MFSI has certified that it has not
agreed and will not agree in the future to accept special concessions directly or indirectly
from any foreign carrier.  MFSI further certifies that it is affiliated with a number of foreign
carriers.  MFSI is not affiliated with any carrier in either Australia or New Zealand.  

        7.      Section 63.18(e)(6) of our rules requires that applications for cable landing
licenses include a list of the proposed owners of the cable, and their voting interests and
ownership interests by segment in the cable.  We find that MFSI has provided us with
sufficient information about the ownership interests of the U.S. mainland, Australia, and
New Zealand cable landing stations and the submarine cable.  The two U.S. mainland cable
landing stations will be owned and operated exclusively by MFSI, including the electronics
and cable segments between the landing station and the territorial limits of the United States. 
Telecom New Zealand Limited (TNZL) and Optus Communications Pty, Ltd. (Optus) will
each own 100 percent of the landing stations, electronics, and cable segments between the
landing stations and the territorial limits of their respective home countries.  MFSI will own
10 percent of the special purpose corporation that will own the remaining wet segments of
the cable, and the other 90 percent will be owned by Optus and TNZL.  As for the Hawaii
landing station, MFSI informs us that the ownership of this landing station has not yet been
determined.  To ensure that the Commission has detailed information about the ownership
and voting interests for the entire cable system before MFSI lands and operates the proposed
cable, we condition final grant of this license upon MFSI's filing of specific ownership and
voting interests for the Hawaii landing station.  We will give public notice of this
information and this condition will be considered satisfied unless the Commission issues a
public notice to the contrary no later than sixty days after receipt of this information.

        8.      Consistent with prior decisions, we also find MFSI's statement that the
proposed landing station location sites in the continental United States will be on the Pacific
Coast with at least one landing station located in California, Hawaii, Australia, and New
Zealand sufficient to determine whether the proposed cable would comply with the provisions
of the Cable Landing License Act and Commission rules.  Section 1.767(a) of the
Commission's rules permits applicants in their initial application to provide a general
description of the landing points.  It requires that grant of cable landing license applications
be conditioned upon final approval of a specific description of landing points no later than
ninety days prior to construction.  The Commission will give public notice of this
description, and grant of the license will be considered final unless we issue a public notice
to the contrary no later than sixty days after receipt of the specific description of the landing
points.

        9.      Based on the information provided by MFSI and pursuant to the Commission's
procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, we conclude that
the grant of the requested authorization would not significantly affect the environment. 
Consequently, MFSI is not required to submit an environmental assessment, and this
application is categorically excluded from environmental processing.

      10.    Accordingly, we conclude that U.S. interests under the Cable Landing License
Act will be served by grant of the license to MFSI to land and operate Southern Cross, as
conditioned below.

IV. Ordering Clauses

      11.     Consistent with the foregoing, we hereby GRANT AND ISSUE MFSI a
license to land and operate a fiber optic submarine cable system extending between landing
points at cable landing stations in the west coast of the United States, Hawaii, Australia, and
New Zealand under the provisions of the Cable Landing License Act and Executive Order
10530.   The planned capacity for the Northern Ring (U.S. Mainland to Hawaii traffic) is 50
Gbps.  The planned capacity for the Southern Ring (Australia/New Zealand traffic) is 10
Gbps.  The planned capacity for the North South Ring (U.S. Mainland/Hawaii to
Australia/New Zealand traffic) is 30 Gbps.  This grant is subject to all rules and regulations
of the Federal Communications Commission; any treaties or conventions relating to
communications to which the United States is or may hereafter become a party; any action
by the Commission or the Congress of the United States rescinding, changing, modifying or
amending any rights accruing to any person hereunder; and the following conditions:

             (1)    The location of the cable system within the territorial waters of the
             United States of America, its territories and possessions, and upon its shore
             shall be in conformity with plans approved by the Secretary of the Army, and
             the cables shall be moved or shifted by the Licensee at its expense upon the
             request of the Secretary of the Army, whenever he or she considers such
             course necessary  in the public interest, for reasons of national defense, or for
             the maintenance or improvement of harbors for navigational purposes; 

             (2)    The Licensee shall at all times comply with any requirements of United
             States government authorities regarding the location and concealment of the
             cable facilities, buildings, and apparatus for the purpose of protecting and
             safeguarding the cables from injury or destruction by enemies of the United
             States of America;
 
             (3)    The Licensee or any persons or companies controlling them, controlled
             by them, or under direct or indirect common control with them do not enjoy
             and shall not acquire any right to handle traffic to or from the United States,
             its territories, or its possessions unless such service be authorized by the
             Commission pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act, as amended;

             (4)    The Licensee or any persons or companies controlling them, controlled
             by them, or under direct or indirect common control with them shall not
             acquire or enjoy any right for the purpose of handling or interchanging traffic
             to or from the United States, its territories, or its possessions to land, connect,
             or operate cables or landlines, to construct or operate radio stations, or to
             interchange traffic that is denied to any other United States company by reason
             of any concession, contract, understanding, or working arrangement to which
             the Licensee or any persons controlling them, controlled by them, or under
             direct or indirect common control with them are parties;

             (5)    Neither this license nor the rights granted herein shall be transferred,
             assigned, or in any manner either voluntarily or involuntarily disposed of or
             disposed of indirectly by transfer of control of the Licensee to any persons,
             unless the Federal Communications Commission shall give prior consent in
             writing;

             (6)    The Licensee shall notify the Commission in writing of the precise
             locations at which the cables will land no later than ninety days prior to
             commencing construction of cable landing stations at those locations.  The
             Licensee shall also notify the Commission in writing of the specific ownership
             interests of the Hawaii landing station, including a description of the proposed
             owners and its voting interests.  The Commission will give public notice of the
             filing of these descriptions, and grant of this license will be considered final
             unless the Commission issues a notice to the contrary no later than sixty days
             after receipt of the specific descriptions of the landing points and the specific
             ownership interests of the Hawaii landing station;

             (7)    The Commission reserves the right to require the Licensee to file an
             environmental assessment or environmental impact statement should it
             determine that the landing of the cables at those locations and construction of
             necessary cable landing stations would significantly affect the environment
             within the meaning of Section 1.1307 of the Commission's procedures
             implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; this license is
             subject to modification by the Commission upon its review of any
             environmental assessment or environmental impact statement that it may
             require pursuant to its rules;

             (8)    This license is revocable by the Commission after due notice and
             opportunity for hearing pursuant to section 2 of "An Act Relating to the
             Landing and Operation of Submarine Cables in the United States,"     47
             U.S.C.  35, or for failure to comply with the terms of the authorizations;

             which the cable is placed in service, and this license shall expire 25 years from
             such date, unless renewed or extended upon proper application, and, upon
             expiration of this license, all rights granted under it shall be terminated; and

             (10)   The terms and conditions upon which this license is given shall be
