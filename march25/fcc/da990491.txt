Adopted:  March 10, 1999                           Released:  March 15, 1999

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                         I.  Introduction

     1.   In this Order, we grant the application of Project Oxygen (USA) LLC (O2 (USA)) under
the Cable Landing License Act for authority to land and operate a private fiber optic submarine cable
system to be called the OXYGEN Network, extending between the United States and the overseas points
listed in the attached Appendix.  This system will be operated on a non common carrier basis.  We find
that O2 (USA) has provided sufficient information under our rules to comply with the Cable Landing
License Act and that it would serve the public interest to grant the cable landing license subject to the
conditions listed below.

                        II.  Application 

     2.   O2 (USA), a Delaware corporation, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Project Oxygen Ltd.,
a Bermuda corporation that is wholly owned by CTR Holdings L.P. (CTR), a limited partnership registered
in the State of Delaware.  CTR is owned by individuals and has no affiliation with any foreign
communications carrier.  O2 (USA) will own all of the U.S. landing stations, the U.S. terrestrial facilities,
and all cable segments between the U.S. landing stations and the limit of U.S. territorial waters.  Project
Oxygen Ltd. will own the submarine cable segments in international waters and will act as the overall
manager of the OXYGEN Network.  The application states that, to the extent possible, a party in each
foreign country where the network lands will own the landing station(s) in that country and the cable
segments between the landing station(s) and the limit of that country's territorial waters.

     3.   The first phase of the proposed OXYGEN Network will comprise up to 168,000 km of
fiber optic cable, including 14,000 km of terrestrial segments, linking together a total of 78 countries and
locations on all continents except Antarctica (see Appendix).  This first phase will include 99 landing
points around the world, including 10 in the United States and its territories.

     4.   The basic link design capacity of the OXYGEN Network is 640 gigabits per second
(Gbps).  The network's transmission capacity comprises (a) amplified submarine links of greater than 200
km in length, consisting of four fiber pairs with a total transmission capacity of 640 Gbps; (b) unamplified
submarine links of up to 200 km in length, consisting of 12 fiber pairs with a total transmission capacity of
1.92 terabits per second (Tbps); (c) terrestrial transmission capacity of 1.92 Tbps; and (d) spur capacity of
10 Gbps per wavelength dropped at the spur landing station.  Upon completion of phase one of the
network, the total length of the system, excluding spare fibers, is anticipated to be 168,000 km.  All of the
optical fibers used in the network will support sixteen-color wavelength division multiplexing, with each
color operating at a transmission rate of 10 Gbps (STM-64).  Operation of the OXYGEN Network is
expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2000.

                          III.  Comments

     5.   The application was placed on public notice on October 23, 1998.  We received no
comments.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License Act, and
Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the application.  The Department of
State, after coordinating with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the
Department of Defense, stated that it has no objection to issuance of the cable landing license.

                         IV.  Discussion

     A.   Private Submarine Cable Policy

     6.   O2 (USA) proposes to operate the OXYGEN Network as a non common carrier
submarine cable system in which capacity will not be offered indifferently to the user public.  O2 (USA)
requests a license under the Commission's private submarine cable policy, which is intended to promote
competition in the provision of international transmission facilities.  Pursuant to this policy, the
Commission has authorized non common carrier cables where (1) there is no legal compulsion to serve the
public indifferently and (2) there are no reasons implicit in the nature of the operations to expect that the
applicant would make capacity available to the public indifferently and indiscriminately.

     7.   In applying the first prong of the test to submarine cable authorizations, the Commission
has stated that there will be no legal compulsion to serve the public indifferently where there is no public
interest reason to require facilities to be offered on a common carrier basis.  This public interest analysis
has generally focused on whether an applicant will be able to exercise market power because of the lack of
alternative facilities.  Where there are sufficient alternatives, the Commission has found that the licensee
will lack market power and will not be able to charge monopoly rates for cable capacity.  The Commission
has found that, in those circumstances, the public interest would be served by allowing a submarine cable
to be offered on a non common carrier basis.

     8.   No one has suggested that the public interest requires the OXYGEN Network to be
operated on a common carrier basis.  O2 (USA) is not affiliated with any carriers and therefore does not
control any bottleneck facilities in the markets the OXYGEN Network proposes to serve.  Furthermore, the
applicant argues that the network's proposed operational and management approach effectively requires
that it not be subject to common carrier regulation.  No commenter has disputed this argument, and we
find that, in light of all the circumstances, it would not serve the public interest to impose common carrier
regulation on the operations of the OXYGEN Network at this time.  We note, however, that we retain the
authority to impose common carrier or common-carrier-like obligations on the operations of this or any
other submarine cable system if the public interest so requires.  Furthermore, we have always maintained
the authority to classify facilities as common carrier facilities subject to Title II of the Communications Act
if the public interest requires that the facilities be offered to the public indifferently.

     9.   Regarding the second prong of the test, we conclude that there is no reason to expect that
capacity in the proposed cable system would be held out to the public indifferently.  O2 (USA) states that it
is not a common carrier, does not intend to operate as a common carrier in the future, will not offer service
indiscriminately to the public, will not provide any service that is effectively available to the public, and
will not endeavor to serve all people indifferently.  Rather, the applicant states, it will make individualized
decisions in particular cases whether and on what terms to deal with prospective customers.  We therefore
conclude that O2 (USA) will operate the OXYGEN Network on a non common carrier basis.

     10.  We conclude that O2 (USA) will not offer capacity in the OXYGEN Network to the public
on a common carrier basis and that the public interest does not require that they do so.  Accordingly, we
conclude that it is appropriate to license the OXYGEN Network on a non common carrier basis.  We also
find that the applicant will not provide a telecommunications service for a fee to such class of users as to be
"effectively available directly to the public" and thus will not be "telecommunications carriers" under the
1996 Act.  

     B.   Ownership and Landing Points

     11.  O2 (USA) has provided the ownership information required by Sections 1.767(a)(6),
63.18(e)(6), and 63.18(h) of the Commission's rules.  O2 (USA), a Delaware corporation, is ultimately
controlled by one family, through its ownership of CTR, a limited partnership, which, in turn, owns
Project Oxygen Ltd., the Bermuda corporation.  O2 (USA) is not affiliated with any foreign
communications carrier.  O2 (USA) will own the U.S. cable landing stations, the U.S. terrestrial facilities,
and the cable segments between the U.S. landing stations and the limit of U.S. territorial waters.  Project
Oxygen Ltd. will own the submarine cable segments in international waters.

     12.  The application states that there will be 10 landing points in the United States, its
territories and possessions: at Nedonna, Oregon; San Francisco, California; San Luis Obispo, California;
Tuckerton, New Jersey; Boston, Massachusetts; West Palm Beach, Florida; Agana, Guam; Honolulu,
Hawaii; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Midway Islands.  The non-U.S. landing points are identified in the
Appendix to this Order.  We find the applicant's description of the likely landing points to be sufficient to
determine that the proposed cable system will comply with the provisions of the Cable Landing License Act
and Commission rules.  Section 1.767(a) of the Commission's rules permits applicants in an initial
application to provide a general description of the landing points.  The applicant must file a specific
description of any landing point, including a map, no later than 90 days prior to construction at that landing
point.  The Commission will give public notice of the filing of the specific description, and grant of the
license will be considered final with respect to that landing point unless the Commission notifies the
applicants to the contrary no later than 60 days after receipt of the specific description of the landing point.

     C.   Environmental Impact

     13.  Based on the information provided by the applicant and pursuant to the Commission's
procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, we find that action on the
present application would not significantly affect the environment according to Section 1.1307(a) or (b) of
the Commission's rules.  Therefore, pursuant to Section 1.1306, we conclude that grant of the requested
license would not significantly affect the environment.  Consequently, O2 (USA) is not required to submit
an environmental assessment, and this application is categorically excluded from environmental processing. 
As stated above, however, we condition this license upon final approval of each landing point.  If
necessary, we will address environmental impacts after the applicant specifically identifies the landing
points.

                         IV.  Conclusion

     14.  We grant O2 (USA)'s application for authority to land and operate a non common carrier
fiber optic submarine cable extending between the United States and various overseas points, as described
in the Appendix to this order, subject to the conditions listed below.

                      V.  Ordering Clauses 

     15.  Consistent with the foregoing and pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act and
Executive Order 10530, we hereby GRANT AND ISSUE O2 (USA) a license to land and operate a
