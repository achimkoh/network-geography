                          CABLE LANDING LICENSE


   Adopted:  October 1, 1996                    Released:  October 3, 1996

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

 1.In this Order, we grant the application of MFS Globenet, Inc., ("MFS Globenet") under
the Cable Landing License Act for authority to land and operate a private fiber optic submarine
telecommunications cable system, "MFS-1" and "MFS-2," extending between the United States and the
United Kingdom.  These cables will be connected to form a fully redundant fiber optic ring between
the United States and the United Kingdom.  Their landing points will be in the New York City area
and in the Lands End area of Cornwall in the United Kingdom.  MFS Globenet will operate the cable
system on a non common carrier basis.  We find that the proposed cable system would serve the
public interest by providing additional capacity and cost-efficient communications between the United
States and the United Kingdom.  We find that MFS Globenet has provided sufficient information
under our rules to comply with the Cable Landing License Act and therefore grant the cable landing
license, subject to the conditions listed below.

                              The Application

 2.MFS Globenet is a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of MFS
International, Inc. ("MFSI"), also a Delaware corporation.  MFS Globenet will own the beach head
cable segments and will own and operate the landing station facilities.  MFS Communications Limited
("MFSL"), a wholly owned subsidiary of MFS Globenet, is expected to be the owner of the
corresponding facilities in the United Kingdom, subject to anticipated regulatory developments in the
United Kingdom.  MFS Globenet and/or a wholly owned subsidiary of MFS Globenet will own 100
percent of the "wet" portion of the submarine cable system.  MFSI is 100-percent owned by MFS
Communications Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation the shares of which no single shareholder
owns 10 percent or more.

 3.The proposed cables will use optical fiber technology that employs the appropriate
transmission rate necessary to meet the capacity requirements of the users.  They will be constructed
using state-of-the-art SDH transport equipment and optical amplifiers.  Each cable will consist of two
fiber pairs, each supporting two multiplexed STM-16 systems, resulting in a transmission speed of 5
Gbps per fiber pair and an entire cable capacity of 10 Gbps, or 4,032 E1 circuit equivalents.  The
cable system will be designed to operate at and support the standard circuit speeds of E1, DS3, STM-
1, and STM-4.  The cables together will form a fully redundant fiber optic ring that provides its own
restoration services.

 4.The capacity of the cable system will be sold or leased to users on a non-tariffed,
non common carrier basis.  MFS Globenet will offer bulk capacity to a specific class of eligible users,
including common carriers, on the basis of ownership, indefeasible rights of use, or lease of capacity. 
MFS Globenet states that it will not hold itself out indifferently to serve the public and will make
individual decisions, in particular cases, about whether and on what terms to deal.  It states that it is
therefore not required to apply for authority under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934
because it is not offering the proposed services on a common carrier basis, and it urges the
Commission to consider its application pursuant only to the Cable Landing License Act.

                                 Comments

 5.MFS Globenet's application was placed on public notice on June 21, 1996.  On July 19,
Atlantic Express Communications, L.L.C., filed a Petition to Deny, arguing that the application is
deficient and should be denied or dismissed.

 6.Atlantic Express argues that MFS Globenet has provided insufficient information as to the
ownership of the proposed cable.  It argues that without specific information as to the ownership of
the cable, the Commission cannot make the findings necessary under the Cable Landing License Act. 
Atlantic Express also argues that the fact that MFSI and its subsidiaries would own and control both
ends of the cable system presents an important policy issue that may have precedential implications for
other applications to the United Kingdom and other destination countries.  Atlantic Express would
have us act on this application "only . . . in the context of the principles it may establish for action on
applications by foreign entities for end-to-end ownership."  Finally, Atlantic Express asserts that MFS
Globenet has not provided the information required by Section 1.767 of our rules with respect to the
additional cable referred
to in its August 1 amendment.

 7.In its opposition to Atlantic Express's petition, MFS Globenet argues that it has provided
sufficient ownership information under the Commission's rules.  It states that the cable stations in the
United States and the United Kingdom would be 100-percent owned by a wholly owned MFS affiliate. 
On September 5, 1996, MFS Globenet filed a letter clarifying that MFS Globenet and/or a wholly
owned subsidiary of MFS Globenet would also own 100 percent of the "wet" portion of the cable
system.

 8.MFS Globenet also argues that the proposed end-to-end ownership should weigh in its
favor because the issues of reciprocity and national security that arise when foreign entities propose to
land cables in the United States do not arise here.  It explains that MFS Globenet is a nondominant
U.S. carrier unaffiliated with any dominant foreign carriers, and its ownership and control of both ends
of the cable system eliminates all concerns relating to foreign carriers landing a cable on U.S. shores. 
The applicant also argues that its control of both ends enhances its ability to construct and operate
advanced fiber optic facilities in competition with longer-established providers.

 9.Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License Act,
and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of MFS Globenet's
application.  The Department of State, after coordinating with the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration and the Department of Defense, stated that it has no objection to the
issuance of the cable license.

                                Discussion

 10.MFS Globenet requests a license under the Commission's private submarine cable policy
to promote competition in the provision of international transmission facilities.  Pursuant to this
policy, the Commission has authorized non common carrier cables where there is no legal compulsion
to serve the public indifferently and no reason implicit in the nature of the operations to expect an
indifferent holding-out to the eligible user public.

 11.Because of the wide availability of common carrier circuits on existing and future cables
and satellite circuits between the United States and the United Kingdom, there is no public-interest
reason to require that MFS Globenet's proposed cable facilities be provided on a common carrier
basis.  Also, in light of the sizable demand for telecommunications facilities, we see no prospect of
creating significant overcapacity by the introduction of non common carrier facilities so as to threaten
the economic viability of existing common carrier cable or satellite facilities.  Thus, there is no
reason to require MFS Globenet to operate the proposed cable on a common carrier basis.

 12.In addition, because MFS Globenet will make "individualized decisions, whether and on
what terms to deal" and does not undertake to "carry for all people indifferently," there is no reason
to expect that the proposed cable circuits would be held out to the public indifferently.  We thus
conclude that MFS Globenet will not offer capacity in the MFS-1 and MFS-2 cables to the public on a
common carrier basis and thus is not subject to regulation under Title II of the Communications Act.

 13.With respect to Atlantic Express's concerns about the sufficiency of information provided
regarding ownership of the cable, MFS Globenet has supplemented its application by stating that the
undersea portion of the cable will be wholly owned by MFS Globenet and/or a wholly owned
subsidiary of MFS Globenet.  On that basis, we find that the information submitted by the applicant as
to ownership of each part of the proposed cable is sufficient to comply with Section 63.18 and for us
to evaluate the application under the Cable Landing License Act.

 14.We agree with MFS Globenet that ownership of both ends of the cable by MFSI and its
subsidiaries would enhance competition in the United States and the United Kingdom, because MFS's
U.K. affiliate is a relatively new entrant in the United Kingdom and thus does not possess market
power.  In addition, MFS Globenet's U.S. affiliates are regulated as non-dominant.  We also agree that
end-to-end cable ownership by a U.S.-owned company or its affiliates does not raise any reciprocity or
national security issues.

 15.Consistent with prior decisions, we find that MFS Globenet's descriptions that MFS-1 and
MFS-2 will land "in the New York City area, including Long Island, and central New Jersey" and "in
the Lands End area of Cornwall" to be sufficient to determine whether the proposed cable system
would comply with the provisions of the Cable Landing License Act and Commission rules. 
Pursuant to Section 1.767(a)(5) of the Commission's rules, MFS Globenet must provide a specific
description of the landing locations, including a map, no later than ninety days prior to construction,
and we condition this license upon final approval of the landing points.  The Commission will give
public notice of this description, and grant of the license will be considered final unless we issue a
public notice to the contrary no later than sixty days after receipt of the specific description of the
landing points.

 16.Because MFS Globenet's August 1 amendment stated that MFS-2 will operate together
with MFS-1 as a fully redundant fiber optic ring, we find that it is not an "individual cable system" for
which a separate application is required under Section 1.767(e).  The information provided in the
application and the amendment is therefore sufficient to enable the Commission to grant a single cable
landing license for the entire proposed system.

 17.Based on the information provided by MFS Globenet and pursuant to the Commission's
procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, we conclude that the grant
of the requested authorizations would have no significant effect on the quality of the human
environment and is therefore categorically excluded from environmental processing.  Consequently,
MFS Globenet is not required to submit an environmental assessment with this application.

 18.Accordingly, we conclude that U.S. interests under the Cable Landing License Act will
be served by grant of the license to MFS Globenet, as conditioned below.

                             Ordering Clauses

 19.Consistent with the foregoing, we hereby GRANT AND ISSUE, under the provisions of
the Cable Landing License Act and Executive Order 10530, MFS Globenet, Inc., a license to land and
operate a cable system consisting of two high-capacity fiber optic digital submarine cables (two fiber
pairs each, operating at 5 Gbps per fiber pair) extending between the United States and the United
Kingdom, with landing points in the New York City area, including Long Island and central New
Jersey, and the Lands End area of Cornwall in the United Kingdom.  This grant is subject to all rules
and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission; any treaties or conventions relating to
