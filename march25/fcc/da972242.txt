                         ORDER ON RECONSIDERATION

   Adopted:  October 21, 1997                                           Released:  October 22, 1997

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

      1.  In this Order on Reconsideration, we set aside, on our own motion pursuant to Section
1.108 of the Commission's rules, one restriction that we imposed on a cable landing license recently
granted to SSI Atlantic Crossing, LLC ("SSI").  Specifically, we set aside the requirement that SSI
seek Commission approval prior to the sale or transfer to a foreign entity of five percent or more in
the aggregate of indirect ownership in SSI.

      2.  In the order granting the cable landing license, we acknowledged that the licensee would
be indirectly wholly owned by Tyco International Limited ("Tyco"), which is a publicly traded
corporation.  SSI would therefore be in violation of its license if foreign entities were to purchase in
the aggregate five percent or more of Tyco stock on a stock exchange, an event over which SSI has
no control and no ability to seek prior Commission approval.  SSI advises us that it therefore cannot
accept the terms and conditions upon which the license was granted.

      3.  We have not routinely imposed this restriction on indirect ownership in the past, nor did
we intend the consequences envisioned here.  Upon further reflection, we are satisfied that the
remaining restrictions in the cable landing license, as herein modified, are sufficient to protect the
public interest in this case.  For example, there can be no transfer of control of SSI or Tyco without
prior Commission consent, and any change in direct ownership of SSI of five percent or more
requires prior Commission consent.  SSI is obligated to comply with any requirements of United
States government authorities regarding the location and concealment of the cable facilities, and the
license is revocable for failure to comply with those requirements or any other terms of the license.

      4.  Accordingly, we remove the words "or indirect" from the eighth condition attached to the
cable landing license.  That is, we will not require SSI to obtain Commission approval prior to the
acquisition of five percent or more of Tyco shares by one or more foreign entities.  We will,
however, maintain the requirement that SSI obtain Commission approval before the sale or transfer of
five percent or more of the direct ownership of SSI.

                             Ordering Clauses

      5.  Consistent with the foregoing and pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act, Executive
Order 10530, and Section 1.108 of the Commission's rules, we hereby set aside, in part, one
condition imposed in the license granted to SSI Atlantic Crossing LLC to land and operate a
non common carrier cable system, DA 97-2034.  We remove the words "or indirect" from the eighth
condition attached to that license (as paragraph 15(8)).  That condition now provides as follows:

      (8)  The Licensee shall, by application, obtain Commission approval prior to the sale or
      transfer to a foreign entity of five percent or more in the aggregate of direct ownership in the
      licensee;

      6.  This Order on Reconsideration does not modify any other terms or conditions imposed in
the license issued on September 23, 1997.

      7.  This Order is issued under Sections 0.261 and 1.108 of the Commission's rules, 47
C.F.R.  0.261, 1.108, and is effective upon release.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section
1.106 or applications for review under Section 1.115 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.106,
1.115, may be filed within 30 days of the date of public notice of this order (see 47 C.F.R. 
1.4(b)(2)).
