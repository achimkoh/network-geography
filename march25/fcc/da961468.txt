                         ORDER AND AUTHORIZATION


   Adopted:  August 28, 1996                                     Released:  August 30, 1996



By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

     1.  On July 2, 1996, International Telecommunicatons Corporation ("ITC"); Intelco,
Global Information Services, Ltd. ("IGIS"); and Cyberlink, Inc. ("Cyberlink") (collectively "the
Applicants") filed the above-captioned application pursuant to Section 214 of the
Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and "An Act Relating to the Landing and Operation
of Submarine Cables in the United States," 47 U.S.C.  34-39, requesting authority to transfer
control of their parent corporation, International Telecommunications Group, Ltd. ("ITG") to RSL
Communications Limited ("RSL").  The Applicants also requested Special Temporary Authority
to effectuate the transfer of control by July 12, 1996.  The above-captioned application was
placed on public notice on July 15, 1996.  No comments were received.

     2.  On July 12, 1996, we granted the Applicants' request for special temporary authority
to transfer control.  By this order, we grant the Applicants final authority to transfer control of
ITG to RSL.

                                  Parties

     3.  ITG, a Delaware corporation, does not itself hold any authorizations under Section 214
of the Communications Act.  Its operating subsidiaries include the Applicants.  ITG's principal
shareholders are RSL and Charles M. Piluso, who respectively own approximately 50% and
44.25% of ITG's stock.

     4.  ITC is authorized to provide domestic interstate and international services as a non-
dominant carrier.  ITC has global Section 214 authority pursuant to Section 63.18(e)(1) and (e)(2)
of the Commission's rules to provide all international facilities-based and resale services to all
points in the world subject to the Commission's exclusion list.  ITC also holds various other
Section 214 authorizations, as well as submarine cable landing licenses as listed in Appendix A.

     5.  IGIS, a Delaware corporation, is a wholly owned subsidiary of ITC.  In a separate
filing submitted on June 26, 1996, IGIS has requested authority pursuant to Section 214 and
Section 63.18(e)(2) of the Commission's rules to resell the international telecommunications
services of other authorized carriers.

     6.  Cyberlink, a California corporation, is authorized under Section 214 to resell the
switched message telephone service of existing carriers to provide international switched voice
service between the United States and various overseas points, to resell non-interconnected
private lines to provide private line service to various foreign points, to resell private lines to
provide switched services between the United States and Canada, the United Kingdom and
Sweden, and to provide facilities-based services (via INTELSAT and other facilities) between the
United States and various foreign points.  Cyberlink's principal shareholder, owning 51% of its
capital stock, is ITC.

     7.  RSL, a privately held international holding company organized under the laws of the
United Kingdom, is not currently a carrier under Section 214.  Its parent corporation, RSL
Communications, Inc. ("RSL Com"), is a British Virgin Islands corporation authorized under
Section 214 to resell international switched telecommunications services.  The majority
shareholder of RSL Com is R.S. Lauder, Gaspar and Company, L.P. ("RSLAG"), a limited
partnership organized under the laws of Delaware.  The general partner of RSLAG is Bukfenc,
Inc., a New York corporation whose president and majority, controlling shareholder is Andrew
Gaspar.  The majority interest holders of RSLAG are Ronald S. Lauder and members of the
Lauder family.  Messrs. Gaspar and Lauder and all other interest holders in RSLAG are United
States citizens, as are all officers and directors of RSL.  United States citizens also hold
approximately 98% of the capital stock of RSL Com.  Mr. Nir Tarlovsky, a citizen of Israel, is
a director and Vice President of RSL Com.

                                Discussion

     8.  ITG, RSL, and Charles M. Piluso have entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement
whereby RSL has agreed to purchase 106,985 shares of common stock of ITG held by Mr.
Piluso, giving RSL a controlling interest (84.2% on a fully diluted basis) in the company.  In
consideration for these shares, Mr. Piluso will receive specified cash payments.  Pursuant to the
terms of a separate Exchange Agreement, Mr. Piluso will also have the right to sell to RSL an
additional number of ITG shares, equivalent to 5% of the company's outstanding capital stock,
in exchange for 5% of the total number of shares of common stock of RSL Com outstanding. 
The application states that this latter acquisition of shares would not result in a transfer of control
of RSL Com.

     9.  The Applicants request authorization for the transfer of control of ITG that would
result from execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement.  The Applicants state that a grant of this
application would serve the public interest in permitting competitive international service
companies such as ITC, IGIS, and Cyberlink to operate in the international service market.  They
state that ITC and Cyberlink critically need an immediate infusion of capital in order to meet
their operating and other costs and avoid termination of service to customers, and that RSL is
prepared to provide the needed capital if the proposed transaction takes place.

     10.  After due consideration of the facts and circumstances presented by this application,
we conclude that the proposed transfer of control of ITG to RSL would serve the public interest,
convenience, and necessity.  As argued by the Applicants, we believe that the proposed
acquisition will serve the public interest by promoting competition in the market for international
services by allowing the Applicants to meet their financial obligations and to draw upon the
substantial technical and managerial expertise of RSL Com.

                             Ordering Clauses

     11.  Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act

 63.18, that the application of ITC, IGIS, and Cyberlink, File No. I-T-C-96-370-TC, IS
GRANTED, and we consent to the transfer of control, nunc pro tunc as of July 12, 1996, to RSL
of ITG, the parent corporation of the holders of the pending and granted international Section 214
authorizations and interests in cable landing licenses listed in Appendix A.

     12.  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all terms and conditions of all Commission orders
granting authority to ITC, IGIS, and Cyberlink to provide common carrier services remain in
effect.

     13.  This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's Rules, 47 C.F.R.
 0.261, and is effective upon adoption.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106 or
applications for review under Section 1.115 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.106, 1.115,
may be filed within 30 days of public notice of this order (see Section 1.4(b)(2), 47 C.F.R.
 1.4(b)(2)).
