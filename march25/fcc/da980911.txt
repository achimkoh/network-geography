                   MODIFICATION OF CABLE LANDING LICENSE

   Adopted:  May 12, 1998                        Released:  May 15, 1998

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                             I.  Introduction

        1.  In this Order, we modify the cable landing license recently granted to several parties for
authority to land and operate a digital submarine cable system to be called the PAN AMERICAN
Cable System (PAN AMERICAN).  We grant the application of Telef¢nica Larga Distancia de Puerto
Rico, Inc. (TLD) under the Cable Landing License Act to add TLD as a licensee of PAN
AMERICAN.  PAN AMERICAN will extend between the U.S. Virgin Islands, Aruba, Venezuela,
Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Peru and Chile and will be operated on a common carrier basis.  We
find that TLD has provided sufficient information under our rules to comply with the Cable Landing
License Act and therefore grant the cable landing license modification subject to the conditions listed
below.

                             II.  Application

        2.  TLD is a corporation organized under the laws of Puerto Rico.  TLD is a common carrier
subject to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.  TLD states that it has an ownership interest
in those portions of PAN AMERICAN located in U.S. territory.

        3.  PAN AMERICAN will be a common carrier system owned by TLD and by a number of
other U.S. and foreign telecommunications entities authorized to land and operate an international
submarine fiber optic cable system in Aruba, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Peru and Chile.
The proposed PAN AMERICAN system will extend between landing points at cable stations in St.
Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands; St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands; Baby Beach, Aruba; Punto Fijo,
Venezuela; Barranquilla, Colombia; Colon, Panama; Panama City, Panama; Punta Carnero, Ecuador;
Lurin, Peru; and Arica, Chile and will be connected with the domestic networks in those countries or
territories.

        4.  A description of the cable system is contained in our original order granting a cable
landing license for PAN AMERICAN.

                              III.  Comments

        5.  TLD's application was placed on public notice on November 5, 1997.  No comments were
received.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License Act,
and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the application.  The
Department of State advised the Commission that it has no objection to the modification of the cable
landing license.

                              IV.  Discussion

        6.  TLD certifies that it is affiliated with foreign carriers in Spain, Argentina, Chile, Peru, and
Romania.  It is therefore affiliated with foreign carriers in three countries where PAN AMERICAN
will land   Argentina, Chile, and Peru.  We evaluate this application under the policies adopted by
the Commission in its recent Foreign Participation Order.   In that Order, the Commission decided to
apply its open entry policies to applications to land and operate submarine cables between the United
States and World Trade Organization (WTO) Member Countries.  Because Argentina, Chile, and
Peru are members of the WTO, we do not apply the effective competitive opportunities test, and we
presume that there is no competition-based reason to deny TLD's application.  No party has suggested
that this presumption should be rebutted here.  Therefore, we find that TLD's foreign affiliations do
not raise concerns that could persuade us to deny the application under Section 2 of the Cable Landing
License Act.

        7.  Based on the information provided by the TLD and pursuant to the Commission's
procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, we conclude that the grant
of the requested authorization would not significantly affect the environment.  Consequently, TLD is
not required to submit an environmental assessment, and this application is categorically excluded
from environmental processing.

        8.  We recently granted nine parties a cable landing license to land and operate PAN
AMERICAN.  By granting this modification, we authorize TLD to own and operate in the United
States a share of that same cable system.  TLD shall be considered a Licensee of PAN AMERICAN
for the purpose of condition 7 of the PAN AMERICAN licensees' cable landing license.

        9.  Accordingly, we conclude that U.S. interests under the Cable License Landing Act will be
served by grant of the license to TLD to land and operate PAN AMERICAN, subject to all of the
terms and conditions in the original cable landing license, DA 98-81, File No. SCL-97-001.
        
                           V.  Ordering Clauses

        10.  In consideration of the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED that the application, File Nos. SCL-
97-006 and SCL-97-001(M), is GRANTED.  The PAN AMERICAN cable landing license, SCL-97-
001, is MODIFIED to add Telef¢nica Larga Distancia de Puerto Rico, Inc., as a licensee.  This grant
is subject to all rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission; any treaties or
conventions relating to communications to which the United States is or may hereafter become a party;
any action by the Commission or the Congress of the United States rescinding, changing, modifying or
amending any rights accruing to any person hereunder; and the conditions contained in the cable
landing license, SCL-97-001.

        11.  TLD shall accept the terms and conditions of this license by filing a letter with the
Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554 within 30 days of the
release of this modification.

        12.  This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  0.261,
and is effective upon release.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106 or applications for
review under Section 1.115 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.106, 1.115, may be filed within
30 days of the date of public notice of this order (see 47 C.F.R.  1.4(b)(2)).
