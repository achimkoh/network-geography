MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

Adopted:  April 30, 2001	Released: May 1, 2001

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division, International Bureau:

I.	Introduction
1.	In this Order, we grant the application of Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones S.A. 
("ENTEL-Chile") and STET International Netherlands N.V. ("STET") (together, "Applicants") seeking 
authority to transfer control of the cable landing license interests held by Americatel Corporation 
("Americatel") in the PAN AMERICAN Cable System ("PAN AMERICAN") from ENTEL-Chile to 
STET. 
2.	On January 20, 1998, we granted a joint application by Americatel and numerous other 
parties, pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act,  and Executive Order No. 10530,  to land and operate 
a common carrier submarine fiber optic cable system, called PAN AMERICAN, extending between the 
U.S. Virgin Islands, Aruba, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Peru and Chile. 
3.	Americatel, a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, is authorized to 
provide U.S. international service pursuant to its Section 214 authorization.  It provides domestic 
interexchange service pursuant to blanket Section 214 authority and domestic intrastate service pursuant to 
various state authorizations.  Americatel's ownership and voting interests in the PAN AMERICAN cable 
are each 0.41633 percent.  
4.	ENTEL-Chile, a corporation organized under the laws of Chile, is one of the largest domestic 
and international long distance carriers in Chile.   We previously have found that ENTEL-Chile does not 
control bottleneck services or facilities that can be used to discriminate against unaffiliated U.S. carriers 
terminating traffic in Chile.   ENTEL-Chile holds a 100-percent ownership interest in ENTEL International 
B.V.I. Corporation ("ENTEL B.V.I."), a company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands.  
ENTEL B.V.I., in turn, holds an 80-percent ownership interest in Americatel.  
5.	STET, a corporation organized under the laws of The Netherlands, is a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Telecom Italia S.p.A. ("Telecom Italia"), one of the world's largest fixed telecommunications 
operators that is incorporated as a joint stock company under the laws of Italy.  In addition to wireline 
operations, Telecom Italia, through its subsidiary Telecom Italia Mobile S.p.A., is one of the largest mobile 
telecommunications operators in Europe.  Through international investments in Europe and Latin America, 
Telecom Italia and its subsidiaries also provide data services, satellite telecommunications services, and 
information technology software and services.  Two subsidiaries of Telecom Italia – Telecom Italia of 
North America and Telemedia International USA, Inc. – hold Section 214 authorizations.    
6.	STET currently owns a 26.16 percent voting interest in ENTEL-Chile.  Through a stock 
purchase agreement, STET will acquire an additional 25.63 percent voting interest in ENTEL-Chile from 
Chilquinta Telecomunicaciones S.A. (10.62 percent) and Chilquinta S.A. (15.01 percent). STET will 
acquire an additional 2.9789 percent voting interest in ENTEL-Chile from some of the minority 
shareholders.  As a result of these transactions, STET will hold a controlling interest of 54.76 in ENTEL-
Chile, and thus STET will acquire an indirect controlling interest in Americatel once the transactions are 
consummated. 
7.	On February 12, 2001, we granted the Applicants' request for Special Temporary Authority to 
permit transfer of control of the PAN AMERICAN cable landing authorization held by Americatel from 
ENTEL-Chile to STET.  
II.	Comments
8.	We placed the Application on public notice on January 26, 2001.   We received no comments. 
 Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules,  the Cable Landing License Act, and Executive 
Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the transfer of control request.  The Department 
of State, after coordinating with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the 
Department of Defense, stated that it has no objection to approving the Applicants' request to transfer 
control of the cable landing license of Americatel from ENTEL-Chile to STET. 
III.	Discussion
9.	Under Section 1.767(a)(8) of the Commission's rules, applicants are required to disclose their 
affiliations with foreign carriers.   STET has certified that it is not a foreign carrier within the meaning of 
Section 63.09(d) of the Commission's rules,  but that it is affiliated with foreign carriers in the following 
countries:  Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bolivia, Canada, Chile, China, Cuba, El Salvador, France, 
Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, The Netherlands, Peru, 
Russia, Romania, San Marino, Spain, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of 
Yugoslavia.   According to the Application, STET is affiliated with the following foreign carriers in Peru 
and Chile, landing points for PAN AMERICAN:  TIM Peru, S.A.C. and ENTEL-Chile.  Applicants 
assert that all destination markets, including Peru and Chile, are WTO member countries.   Applicants 
further assert that the market share in the international transport and local access markets of each of its 
affiliated foreign carriers in Peru and Chile is significantly less than 50 percent.   We conclude, therefore, 
that STET's affiliated foreign carriers do not possess market power that would allow them to discriminate 
against unaffiliated U.S. carriers through control of bottleneck facilities in Peru or Chile, and we see no 
reason to deny Applicants' request to transfer control of the cable landing license of Americatel to STET 
on the basis of STET's foreign affiliations.
10.	We also conclude that the transfer of control of ENTEL-Chile's interest to STET raises no 
competitive concerns.   Specifically, we conclude that STET's ownership of a 0.41633 percent interest in 
PAN AMERICAN will not cause competitive concerns.  Additional cables serve the route, and more are 
coming on line.   Moreover, the amount of ownership interest that STET will acquire in PAN 
AMERICAN as a result of this transfer of control is insubstantial. 
11.	Applicants assert that the proposed transfer of control will serve the public interest because 
Americatel will be backed by Telecom Italia, an entity with management experience, workforce and means 
to strengthen Americatel's ability to bring competitive integrated telecommunications services to consumers 
in the United States.  Applicants state that the transfer of control will allow Americatel to manage its 
telecommunications operations more efficiently, thereby permitting greater investment in facilities, 
customer service and technological innovation.  Therefore, Applicants state, the transfer of control will 
result in a company better equipped to accelerate its growth as a competitive telecommunications service 
provider.  Finally, Applicants contend that the transfer of control will be consummated in a seamless 
fashion that will be transparent to customers and not in any way inconvenience or cause harm to 
Americatel's customers. 
12.	Upon consideration of the record in this proceeding, and in view of the foregoing, we conclude 
that grant of the transfer of control sought in the Application will serve the public interest and is consistent 
with the Cable Landing License Act.
13.	We modify the initial authorization to reflect these transactions.  We do not modify the initial 
authorization in any other respect.
IV.	Ordering Clauses
14.	Consistent with the foregoing and pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act and Executive 
Order 10530, IT IS ORDERED that the Application, File No. SCL-T/C-20010119-00001, IS GRANTED, 
the transactions listed herein are authorized, and the PAN AMERICAN Cable Landing License (File. No. 
SCL-LIC-19970421-00002, formerly File. No. SCL-97-001) IS HEREBY MODIFIED to reflect those 
transactions.
15.	This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R. § 0.261, and is 
effective upon adoption.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106 or applications for review under 
Section 1.115 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R. §§ 1.106, 1.115, may be filed within 30 days of the 
date of public notice of this Order.
