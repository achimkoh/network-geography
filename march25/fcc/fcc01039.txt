                        ORDER ON REVIEW

Adopted:  February 1, 2001                   Released: February 8, 2001

By the Commission:  Commissioner Furchtgott-Roth approving in part, dissenting in part, and issuing a
statement. 

                         I.Introduction
     
 1.  The Commission has before it three applications for review of an order of the International
Bureau's Telecommunications Division (Division) granting authority to General Communications, Inc.
(GCI) to land and operate the Alaska United Cable System (Alaska United).  The Applications for
Review raise both substantive and procedural arguments. With respect to the substantive
arguments, we have considered the arguments raised in the Applications for Review and find that
the Division staff properly decided the matters before it. Moreover, for the reasons discussed
below, we conclude that none of the Applicants' procedural arguments warrant revisiting the
Division's decision.  We therefore deny the Applications for Review and affirm the Division's
decision for the reasons stated therein.

                         II.Background

 2.  The Division authorized Alaska United as a non-common carrier submarine fiber
optic cable system, to extend between the Pacific Northwest United States and Alaska.  The
Division authorized Alaska United to operate a fiber optic cable system consisting of three
undersea cable segments, with each segment consisting of a pair of fibers in the following manner:
segment 1 extending between south central Alaska and the Pacific Northwest United States;
segment 2 extending between south central Alaska and Juneau, Alaska; and segment 3 extending
between Juneau, Alaska and the Pacific Northwest United States.

 3.  ATU-Long Distance, Inc. (ATU-LD), TelAlaska Long Distance (TelAlaska-
LD)/ASTAC Long Distance, Inc. (ASTAC-LD), and Alaska Network Systems, Inc. (ANS)
(Applicants) each filed Applications for Review of the Division Order.  GCI filed an Opposition
to the Applications for Review, and ATU-LD, TelAlaska-LD/ASTAC-LD, and ANS each filed
replies to GCI's Opposition. 

                         III.Discussion

  1. Substantive Argument/Non-Common Carrier Status.  Applicants' principal substantive
argument before the Division (and one that they repeat here) is that GCI should have been
required to operate the cable on a common carrier basis in order to prevent certain alleged
competitive harms.  We agree with the Division's analysis and conclusion that the availability of
other telecommunications facilities/service capacity on the route, along with the recordkeeping
requirement imposed on the license and the Commission's ability to change the regulatory status
of the cable to common carrier, reasonably obviates concerns about the alleged harms raised by
Applicants. These factors make it unnecessary for the Commission to require that periodic
reporting be made available for public inspection, and not merely upon request by the
Commission, as some parties request.  We also note that the primary economic argument relied
upon in pleadings before the Bureau in opposing the initial grant of the cable landing license on a
non-common carrier basis (and what Applicants repeat here) was that there was not, and would
not be, sufficient facility/service capacity on the route to allay competitive harms.  This key
allegation has been proven wrong.  Significantly, the Northstar Cable System was, in fact, built
and placed into operation, contrary to arguments raised below that the cable would not be placed
into service and could not be relied upon in a competitive assessment.  The Commission can rely
upon both existing and planned facilities/services in making competitive assessments as was done
here for the purpose of reviewing whether the applicable law justified a grant of the application. 
As the Supreme Court has stated:   "[a] forecast of the direction in which the future public interest
lies necessarily involves deductions based on the expert knowledge of the agency."  We also find
that the Division correctly applied the Commission's longstanding private submarine cable policy,
and the court's decision in NARUC I in analyzing GCI's initial application. 

 1.  Procedural Arguments/Sufficiency of Record.  Applicants also raise issues
regarding the sufficiency of the record on which the Division based its decision to grant GCI's
license, which, for the reasons discussed below, we find to be without merit.

 2.  We disagree with ATU-LD's argument that the Division erred in denying its
request for a 30 day extension to submit economic evidence to supplement its legal analysis, and
in setting the comment cycle for the period it did.  Specifically, ATU-LD argues that that the
Division committed prejudicial error under Section 1.115(b)(2)(v) of the Commission's rules by
failing to grant ATU-LD time to present an economist's report on Alaska market conditions. 
ATU-LD attaches to its application for review the economist's report it had hoped to file prior to
the Commission issuing an Order on GCI's application.  In addition, ANS argues that the
comment cycle was too short and the ex parte process was insufficient, particularly in light of
alleged misrepresentations by GCI.  As the Division noted in denying ATU-LD's request for an
extension, the main concern raised in this proceeding is that GCI will have an incentive and ability
to engage in anticompetitive conduct by denying competing carriers access to capacity on Alaska
United.  The Division properly addressed this concern in the Order below, and we agree with the
Division's determination that an extension was not necessary.  In addition, the Commission's
ability to reclassify the cable from non-common carrier to common carrier status, if necessary, will
help ensure that GCI does not engage in anticompetitive behavior.

 3.  We also find no merit in ANS's argument that the record upon which the Division
based its decision did not contain the substance of all of GCI's ex parte presentations to
Commission staff, and that the Division failed to address the serious issue of misrepresentation by
GCI.  Specifically, ANS asserts that there was no ex parte filing in the record memorializing
GCI's conversation with International Bureau staff in which it corrected a misrepresentation about
the public notice of GCI's application.  In response to ANS's argument that there was no public
record of an ex parte presentation in which GCI corrected the misrepresentation, GCI asserts that
no such ex parte notification was required because, at the time, GCI was the only party to the
proceeding.  We agree with GCI that no ex parte notification of GCI's correction of the
misrepresentation (which, in any event, dealt with a fact that was in the Commission staff's own
knowledge) was required because, at the time, GCI was the only party to this proceeding. The
record does not reflect the exact date on which GCI communicated with Commission staff to
correct GCI's misstatement concerning the issuance of a public notice announcing the filing of its
application.  Nevertheless, GCI's communication preceded the issuance of the public notice
announcing the filing of its application and, in turn, the filing of Alascom's and ATU-LD's
comments in this proceeding on October 3, 1997.  With the filing of these comments, GCI was
required to comply with the disclosure requirements of Section 1.1206.

 4.  We also find no merit in ANS's allegation that there is no documentation in the
public record regarding meetings between GCI and International Bureau staff at which proposed
reporting conditions were discussed. ANS generally argues that GCI failed to file summaries of ex
parte presentations with the Commission for inclusion in the public record, and specifically asserts
that there is no documentation in the public record regarding meetings between GCI and Division
staff at which proposed reporting conditions were discussed.  GCI responds that it indeed served
all parties to the proceeding with copies of each of its written submissions to the Division and
filed memoranda summarizing the substance of all oral ex parte meetings that were not already
reflected in its written filings. We conclude that GCI did not violate the Commission's ex parte
rules.  The filed reports of that meeting at which ANS and other interested parties were present
indicate that possible conditions had been previously discussed.  Indeed, possible conditions had
been an issue raised by ATU-LD at the outset, in its comments on GCI's application, and they
had also been addressed in GCI's reply comments.  Thereafter, GCI made an oral ex parte
presentation concerning this matter and filed the necessary summary of its presentation.  In that
filing, GCI summarized arguments delivered in its oral presentation and stated that "[a]ll other
points raised by counsel to GCI are reflected in GCI's written filings in this proceeding." The ex
parte rules require disclosure of an oral presentation only to the extent that it contains data or
arguments not already reflected in a party's written filings.  Because ANS has made no showing
of any new information concerning the imposition of conditions in this proceeding, and because
GCI otherwise has complied in all respects with the ex parte rules, these contentions warrant no
further consideration.

                         IV.Conclusion
 5.  For the reasons discussed above, we deny Applicants' Applications for Review and
affirm the Division's decision below.

                       V.Ordering Clauses

 6.  Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to sections 4(i) and 4(j) of the Act, 47
U.S.C.  154(i), 154(j), and Section 1.115(g) of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.115(g),
that the Applications for Review filed by ATU-Long Distance, Inc., TelAlaska Long
Distance/ASTAC Long Distance, Inc., and Alaska Network Systems, Inc. Corporation ARE
DENIED.

                         Secretary     STATEMENT OF COMMISSIONER HAROLD FURCHTGOTT-ROTH
            APPROVING IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART

Re:  General Communications, Inc. Application for a License to Land and Operate in the United
States a Digital Submarine Cable System Extending Between the Pacific Northwest United States
and Alaska, Order on Review, File No. SCL-LIC-19980602-00008 (rel. February 2, 2001).

     Perhaps the most troubling aspect of today's decision is that it took three years for
the Commission to reach it.   Parties are entitled to the expectation that their Commission
business will be resolved in a prompt manner.  By any measure, today's order fails that test.
Indeed I wish to apologize personally to GCI, ATU-Long Distance, Inc., TelAlaska Long
Distance/ASTAC Long Distance, Inc., and Alaska Network Systems, Inc.  They deserved better
treatment from their government.   Going forward, it is my hope that the Commission will move
aggressively to devote the resources necessary to insure that parties have their claims handled in a
reasonable time. 

As for the merits, I respectfully dissent in part from today's item.  It has been my
longstanding view that the Commission lacks authority over undersea cable landing licenses.  The
Cable Landing License Act (CLLA) provides that "[n]o person shall land or operate in the United
States any submarine cable directly or indirectly . . . connecting one portion of the United States
with any other portion thereof, unless a written license to land or operate such cable has been
issued by the President of the United States."   As I have stated before, I do not believe the
president is permitted to delegate this authority to an independent agency, such as the FCC. 
Nevertheless, I concur with today's decision to the extent that it concludes that GCI did not
violate the ex parte rules.
