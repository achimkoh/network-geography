                          ORDER AND AUTHORIZATION

Adopted: May 29, 1996         Released: June 21, 1996

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:
          1.   The Commission is considering  two applications,
filed by PCI Communications, Inc. (PCI) and International
Telecommunications Corporation (ITC), respectively, pursuant to
Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. PCI
requests authority to acquire and operate facilities in the TPC-5
Cable System.   ITC requests authority to acquire and operate
facilities in the PTAT-1, CANTAT-3, CANUS-1 COLUMBUS-II,
AMERICAS-1 and TPC-5 Cable Systems.  PCI and ITC also filed 
applications to modify the Cable Landing License for the TPC-5
Cable System to include PCI and ITC as owners.  The applications
were placed on public notice on June 23, June 30, July 29, and
August 8, 1995, respectively.  No comments were received.

          2.   PCI, a Guam corporation and ITC, a Delaware
corporation, are in the business of providing common carrier
communications services between the United States and overseas
points.  PCI seeks to acquire on an ownership basis facilities in
the TPC-5 Cable System.  ITC seeks to acquire on an ownership
basis facilities in the TPC-5 Cable System, and on an
Indefeasible Right of User (IRU) basis facilities in the other
Cables Systems set forth in paragraph 1, above.   Since they are
seeking to acquire the TPC-5 facilities on an ownership basis,
they must additionally seek modification of the Cable Landing
License to add themselves as owners.

          3.   In the matter before us, the Department of State,
in coordination with the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration and the Department of Defense, has
advised the Commission that it has no objection to the issuance
of an amended TPC-5 Cable Landing License.

            4.    Upon consideration of the applications and in view
of the foregoing, we find that the present and future public
convenience and necessity require a grant of the instant
applications.

            5.    Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that applications File
Nos. I-T-C-95-394, I-T-C-95-408, S-C-L-92-005(M) and S-C-L-92-
005(M)-2 ARE GRANTED, and

      a.    PCI Communications, Inc. (PCI) is authorized to acquire
      on an ownership basis a one-half interest in and operate one
      E-1 circuit in the TPC-5 Cable System between the United
      States and Hawaii and between Hawaii and Guam, and to lease
      and operate any necessary domestic or overseas connecting
      facilities, for the provision of PCI's regularly authorized
      services between the United States and Guam;

      b.    ITC is authorized to:

            i.    acquire on an ownership basis a one-half interest
            in and operate one E-1 circuit in the TPC-5 Cable
            System between the United States and Hawaii and between
            Hawaii and Guam, for the provision of ITC's regularly
            authorized services between the United States, on the
            one hand,  and Taiwan, Guam, and Japan, on the other
            hand;

            ii.   acquire on an Indefeasible Right of User (IRU)
            basis a one-half interest in and operate  the cable
            circuits listed in the Appendix hereto, for the
            provision of ITC's regularly authorized services
            between the United States and the points listed in the
            Appendix hereto; and
      
            iii. lease and operate any necessary domestic
            connecting facilities and a one-half interest in any
            necessary overseas connecting facilities.

      c.    the TPC-5 cable landing license is amended to include
      PCI and ITC as owners and licensees under the provisions of
      "An Act Relating to the Landing and Operation of Submarine
      Cables in the United States", 47 U.S.C. Sections 34-39 and
      Executive Order 10530, dated May 10, 1954, 3 C.F.R. 1954-58
      (Comp., p. 189(1961)), reprinted in 3 U.S.C.A. Section 301  
      at 1052 (1985).

            6.     IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that our authorization of 
PCI and ITC to provide private lines as part of its authorized
services is limited to the provision of such private lines only
between the United States and one of the countries listed in the
Appendix hereto -- that is, private lines which originate in the
United States and terminate in one of the countries listed in the
Appendix hereto or which originate in one of the countries listed
in the Appendix hereto and terminate in the United States.  In
addition,  PCI and ITC may  not-- and PCI and ITC's tariffs must
state that their customers may not -- connect private lines
provided over these facilities to the public switched network at
either the U.S. or foreign end, or both, for the provision of
international basic switched services, unless authorized to do so
by the Commission upon a finding that the destination country
affords resale opportunities equivalent to those available under
U.S. law, in accordance with Foreign Carrier Entry Order, 11 FCC
Rcd 3873 (1995).  The limitations in this paragraph are subject
to the exceptions contained in Sections 63.01(k)(6)(i) and 63.17

copies of any operating agreements they enter into with their
foreign correspondents with the Commission within 30 days of its
execution, and shall otherwise comply with the filing
requirements contained in Section 43.51 of the Commission's
Rules, 47 C.F.R. 43.51.

Act of 1934, as amended, before adding any circuits or channels
of communication for the provision of service via the PTAT-1 or
CANUS-1 Cable System.

            12.   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that ITC shall comply with
any Department of Treasury licensing which may be required.
            
            13.   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that AT&T shall file with
