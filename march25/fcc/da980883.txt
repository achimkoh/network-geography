MEMORANDUM OPINION, ORDER AND AUTHORIZATION
    
                   Adopted: May 11, 1998                  Released: May 15, 1998

                         
                 By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

I.  Introduction
         
 1.   In this Order, we grant Telef¢nica Larga Distancia de Puerto Rico, Inc.
("TLD") authority, pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act, to acquire and
operate capacity on a common carrier high capacity digital submarine cable system, the
COLUMBUS II Cable System ("COLUMBUS II"), for the provision of international
telecommunications services between the United States and Spain.  We find that TLD has
provided sufficient information to comply with Section 214 of the Communications Act and
therefore grant the authority to acquire and operate capacity in COLUMBUS II, subject to the
conditions described below.  We also find that TLD should be regulated as dominant on the
U.S.-Spain route.  Finally, we condition TLD's authorization to use this cable system for
service to Spain upon TLD's affiliates offering U.S. carriers settlement rates at or below the
relevant benchmark.


II.  Application  

                                    2.     TLD is a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico.  The Puerto Rico Telephone Authority ("PRTA") owns 19% of TLD's stock.  Another
2% of TLD is held by an employee stock ownership plan.  The remaining 79% of TLD is
owned by Telef¢nica International Holding, B.V. ("TI Holding").  TI Holding is a Netherlands
corporation which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Telef¢nica de Espa¤a, S.A. ("TI"), a
corporation organized under the laws of Spain.  TI is 100% owned by Telef¢nica de Espa¤a,
S.A. ("Telef¢nica de Espa¤a"), which is the incumbent provider of domestic and international
communications services in Spain.  TLD has authorization under Section 214 of the
Communications Act to provide global facilities-based and resale services.

III.  Background

 3.     On November 10, 1992, eight U.S. carriers, including TLD's predecessor, LD,
filed joint Section 214 and submarine cable landing license applications for authority to
construct and operate the COLUMBUS II cable system.  On July 26 and 28, 1993, the
Common Carrier Bureau approved the joint Section 214 and cable landing license applications
for seven U.S. carriers but deferred action on TLD's application pending a determination by
the full Commission.  On August 8, 1994, the Commission granted TLD's request for
authority to participate in the construction, acquisition of capacity in, and operation of
COLUMBUS II, but deferred ruling on TLD's request for Section 214 authority to provide
service to Spain on COLUMBUS II.  

 4.     On May 2, 1997, the Commission denied TLD's application for Section 214
authority to provide service to Spain on COLUMBUS II.  The Commission found that U.S.
carriers were barred from providing IMTS service to Spanish customers.  The Spanish market,
therefore, did not pass the first prong of the effective competitive opportunities ("ECO")
analysis that looked at the legal, or de jure, ability of U.S. carriers to enter the foreign
market.  The Commission also found that the inability of U.S. carriers to enter the
communications market in Spain outweighed any potential public interest benefits from
granting TLD's application.

 5.     On January 30, 1998, TLD filed the instant application to obtain Section 214
authority to acquire and operate facilities to provide international facilities-based services
between the United States and Spain.  This authority would allow TLD to provide service to
a country, Spain, where it is affiliated with a foreign carrier, Telef¢nica de Espa¤a.   TLD
certifies that it is affiliated within the meaning of Section 63.18(h)(l)(i) of the Commission's
Rules with Telef¢nica de Espa¤a.

  6.       We placed TLD's application on public notice.  Sprint Communications
Company, L.P. ("Sprint") filed comments requesting that the Commission condition any grant
of TLD's application upon compliance with the Commission's accounting rate benchmarks
and other competitive safeguards.  No other comments were filed.

        IV.                             Discussion

  7.       On November 26, 1997 the Commission adopted final rules in the Foreign
Participation proceeding to create a new regulatory framework in light of the United States'
World Trade Organization ("WTO") market access commitments and the market-opening
commitments of U.S. trading partners.  Pursuant to the Foreign Participation Order, the
Commission removed the ECO standard as a factor of its existing public interest analysis and
replaced the standard with a rebuttable presumption in favor of entry for applicants from
WTO Member countries.  Thus, under the new rules, the Commission applies a rebuttable
presumption that applications for Section 214 authority from carriers from WTO Member
Countries do not pose concerns that would justify denial of an application on competition
grounds.  Absent serious concerns raised by the Executive  Branch regarding national
security, law enforcement, foreign policy, or trade issues or, in the exceptional case where a
carrier's entry presents a very high risk to competition in the U.S. market, we will
expeditiously grant Section 214 applications of carriers from WTO Member countries.

  8.       The Executive Branch did not raise any concerns with this application.  Also,
we find that none of the arguments raised by Sprint in this proceeding demonstrate that
TLD's entry into the U.S. market presents a very high risk to competition in the U.S. market. 
Sprint, which does not oppose a grant of TLD's application, requests that we apply the
competitive safeguards to ensure that TLD and its affiliates do not leverage their market
power to harm competition in the United States.  

 9.     We find that Telef¢nica de Espa¤a has sufficient market power to affect
competition adversely in the U.S. market under the Commission's Rules.  Accordingly, we
will regulate TLD as dominant on the U.S.-Spain route.  As a dominant carrier on the U.S.-
Spain route, TLD must comply with the dominant carrier safeguards set forth in Section
63.10(c)(3) of the Commission's rules as well as the Commission's generally applicable
safeguards for U.S. international carriers.  
  
  10.      Sprint also asks that TLD be subject to the rules set forth in the Commission's
Benchmarks Order.  Pursuant to the Benchmarks Order and the Foreign Participation
Order, we will condition any Section 214 authorization for facilities-based service to an
affiliated market on the affiliated carrier offering U.S. international carriers a settlement rate
for the affiliated market that is at or below the relevant benchmark (15›) adopted in the
Benchmarks Order.  In this instance, we note that Telef¢nica de Espa¤a's settlement rate with
U.S. carriers is .125 SDR (17›) and will go to .1 SDR (13.5›) on July 1, 1998.  Therefore, on
July 1, 1998, this condition will be satisfied.  

 11.    Accordingly, we conclude that the public interest will be served by granting
TLD's application.  Therefore, IT IS HEREBY CERTIFIED that the present and future public
convenience and necessity require a grant of the application as conditioned below.

 12.    IT IS ORDERED that application File No. ITC-98-105 is GRANTED and
Telef¢nica Larga Distancia de Puerto Rico, Inc. ("TLD") is authorized, pursuant to Section

system known as the COLUMBUS II Cable System between the United States and Spain; (2)
acquire capacity in COLUMBUS II for the provision of service between the United States and
Spain; (3) acquire, by lease, such extension facilities as may be required to extend capacity in
COLUMBUS II; (4) activate and operate capacity in COLUMBUS II and in the extension

below the Commission's relevant benchmark.  See id.  231.  

 18.    IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that TLD shall be regulated as a dominant carrier
under Section 63.10 of the rules and shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of
