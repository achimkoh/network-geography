CABLE LANDING LICENSE MODIFICATION

          Adopted:  June 14, 1996       Released:  June 14, 1996

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

INTRODUCTION
               

     1.   Optel Communications, Inc. (Optel) requests a modification
to its license to land and operate a submarine fiber optic cable between
the United States and Canada (CANUS-1).  It seeks to add a branch to
Bermuda (Bermuda branch) extending from the existing CANUS-1
branching unit in the Atlantic Ocean to a landing point in Bermuda in
order to provide services between the United States, Bermuda and
Canada.  Cable capacity in the CANUS-1 system would continue to be
sold or leased on a non-common carrier basis.  We find that the
proposed modification would promote the public interest by providing
additional voice, video and high speed data capacity and reliable, cost-
efficient communications between the United States, Bermuda and
Canada.  We also find that Optel has provided sufficient information to
comply with the Cable Landing License Act, and therefore grant the
modification to the cable landing license.



APPLICATION

     2.   Optel is a privately-held corporation organized under the
laws of the State of Delaware.  It is eighty percent owned by United
States citizens and twenty percent owned by Teleglobe Canada, Inc.
(Teleglobe), the monopoly facilities-based carrier of international traffic
originating or terminating in Canada, except for services between
Canada and the United States.  All of Optel's officers and two-thirds of
its directors are United States citizens.  The proposed modification
seeks to add a Bermuda branch to the CANUS-1 high capacity digital
submarine cable system owned jointly by Optel and by Teleglobe.  Optel
owns 100 percent of the CANUS-1 cable station in the United States and
fifty percent of the international portion of the existing CANUS-1
submarine cable.  Teleglobe owns 100 percent of the CANUS-1 cable
station in Canada and fifty percent of the international portion of the
existing CANUS-1 submarine cable.   

     3.   The Bermuda branch will extend from the existing CANUS-1
branching unit, owned fifty percent by Optel and fifty percent by
Teleglobe, in the Atlantic Ocean to a landing point in Bermuda and will
be used to provide services between the United States, Bermuda and
Canada.  This revised CANUS-1 configuration will maintain one direct
fiber pair, via the branching unit, between the U.S. and Canadian
landing points, and produce a direct fiber pair between the United
States and Bermuda and a direct fiber pair between Bermuda and
Canada.  All CANUS-1 fiber pairs will operate at a nominal speed of 2.5
Gigabits per second (Gbps). 

     4.   Cable & Wireless plc (C&W), a publicly-traded U.K.
corporation, will own and construct the Bermuda branch.  C&W
wholly owns C&W Bermuda, the dominant domestic and international
facilities and services provider in Bermuda and Cable and Wireless
Communications, Inc. (CWI), an authorized U.S. carrier incorporated in
the District of Columbia.  Optel states that AT&T Submarine Systems,
Inc., a U.S. corporation, will supply the submarine cable and repeaters
and the terminal equipment at the Bermuda landing point, and that the
undersea portion of the Bermuda branch will be maintained via the
Atlantic Cable Maintenance Agreement. 
  
     5.   Optel asserts that the Commission held in its Optel
Conditional License decision that there was no public interest reason to
require CANUS-1 capacity to be offered on a common carrier basis and
there was no reason to expect that CANUS-1 capacity offerings would
be made available to serve the public indifferently.  Optel submits that
the Bermuda branch will not alter the essential character of CANUS-1,
nor will it alter Optel's status as a non-common carrier.  Optel
incorporates by reference all information and representations set forth
in its initial cable landing license application.

     6.    Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's Rules, the
Cable Landing License Act and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed
the Department of State of Optel's application.  The Department of
State, after coordinating with the National Telecommunications and
Information Administration and the Department of Defense, stated that
it has no opposition to the grant of the cable landing licenses.

COMMENTS   

      7.    We placed Optel's application for modification on public
notice on January 23, 1996.  In response, TeleBermuda International
Ltd. (TBI) filed a motion to accept late filed comments and comments. 
TBI states that the Bermuda government has selected it to become the
second facilities-based international services carrier in Bermuda, to
compete with C&W Bermuda, the dominant facilities-based
international service provider.  TBI has pending before the Commission
an application for a cable landing license between Bermuda and the
United States.

      8.    In support of its motion, TBI states it inadvertently missed
the deadline for submitting its comments on the modification
application.  TBI submits that based on its interest in the modification
proceeding, the important public interest issues at stake, and the fact
that no party will be prejudiced by submission of the late-filed
comments, the Commission should grant its motion.  In response,
Optel notes that TBI's comments were filed late, but does not oppose
TBI's motion. 

DISCUSSION
     
                                    9.    Although TBI's comments are untimely, given that no party
will be prejudiced, and to ensure a complete record, we find that the
public interest would be served by including TBI's comments in the
record as informal comments pursuant to 47 C.F.R. Section 1.41.

      10.   TBI argues that Optel has provided insufficient information
in support of its application.  It states that the little information that
has been submitted by Optel raises more questions than it answers,
particularly with reference to how it might impact the conditions
imposed in the Optel Final License decision.  
     
     11.  TBI asserts that the modification may involve the sale of an
ownership interest in the CANUS-1 undersea branching unit, thereby
altering ownership percentages in CANUS-1 and violating conditions in
the Optel Final License decision.  It further states that the undersea
branching unit could be used to divert one half of the total CANUS-1
system capacity through Bermuda on a spur to be entirely owned by
C&W.  TBI notes that Condition (7) of the Optel Final License decision
requires Optel to file a copy of any contract, understanding or
agreement, or summary containing the essential terms, conditions and
rates, entered into with Teleglobe, its affiliates, or any partnerships or
joint ventures in which Teleglobe is a participant for the sale or lease of
any capacity on CANUS-1.  It states that the Commission should
satisfy itself that all relevant information has been filed to ensure a
complete public record.
      
     12.  In its reply comments, Optel asserts that TBI's comments are
without merit.  It states that the addition of the Bermuda branch to
CANUS-1 will not violate the conditions in the Optel Final License
decision because it will not alter the CANUS-1 ownership percentages
of either Optel or Teleglobe.  Optel states that no ownership interest in
the CANUS-1 undersea branching unit is being sold.  It submits that
while Optel and Teleglobe each own fifty percent of the international
portion of the existing CANUS-1 submarine cable, as well as the
branching unit that will serve as a junction point, C&W will construct
and own the Bermuda branch.  Optel states that no ownership in the
undersea branching unit is being sold.  Optel asserts that the because
the existing ownership interests of the branching unit will remain
unchanged, the modification will not violate Condition (7) of the
Optel's final license.  Finally, Optel states that Teleglobe's ownership in
CANUS-1 will not change upon grant of Optel's modification
application.  

     13.  We find that Optel has provided sufficient information
about the ownership of the CANUS-1 branching unit and the Bermuda
branch.  The record indicates that the proposed modification does not
change the ownership percentages of the CANUS-1 system or the
Bermuda branching unit.  Optel owns fifty percent (100 percent of the
U.S. end) and Teleglobe owns the other fifty percent (100 percent of the
Canadian end).  We find that no ownership interest will be sold and
thus these percentages will not change.  Finally, we find that the
addition of the Bermuda branch does not change Teleglobe's ownership
interest in CANUS-1.

     14.  TBI also asserts that Optel has failed to provide information
regarding the proposed ready for service date for the Bermuda branch
and the cost for the extension.  TBI states that this information is
relevant to the ultimate ownership percentages and assessment of likely
utilization of the system by U.S. entities such as C&W North America. 
Such entities, TBI states, could seek to obtain capacity with C&W
Bermuda to provide services in a manner which might violate
Condition (3) of the Optel Final License decision, which prohibits the
use of facilities in a discriminatory manner.  TBI requests that the
Commission impose appropriate protections to protect against such
potential abuse. 
 
     15.  TBI notes that C&W Bermuda, in conjunction with C&W
plc, currently maintains a bottleneck control over all submarine cable
facilities landing in Bermuda, including PTAT and CARAC.  It alleges
that the proposed modification configuration may allow carriers the
potential to direct U.S. traffic to and from Bermuda via Canada, to the
detriment of U.S. carriers that are not allowed to compete with
Teleglobe in the Canadian international market.  TBI submits that
protections should be placed on any CANUS-1 modification to guard
against potential abuse by Optel, Teleglobe or C&W.  It requests that
the Commission seek more information from Optel and impose
appropriate conditions to protect against potential abuses of, and to
ensure compliance with, the conditions previously imposed in the Optel
Final License.
 
     16.  Optel responds that the Commission has previously
addressed and resolved concerns that certain carriers will gain the
potential to direct U.S.-originating or -terminating traffic to and from
Bermuda through Canada to the detriment of U.S. carriers.  It asserts
that when the Commission granted Optel its conditional license, the
Commission found that U.S. carriers should be protected against
discriminatory practices.  It states that the Commission held that any
concerns as to the routing restrictions or other practices which may
discriminate against U.S. carriers would be more appropriately
addressed in the context of individual carriers' Section 214
applications.

     17.  In response to TBI's concerns about traffic diversion, Optel
states that in the Optel Order on Reconsideration, the Commission
addressed a similar routing concern raised by AT&T that CANUS-1 will
be used to divert U.S.-European traffic through Canada.  Optel asserts
that the Commission concluded that it does not necessarily view such
routing as harmful and that CANUS-1 should enhance U.S.
international facilities competition.  It also notes that the Commission
stated that in the event that traffic diversion resulted in harm to U.S.
carriers or ratepayers, it would revisit the issue and take corrective
measures through the Section 214 process.
     
     18.  We decline to require Optel to provide information in its
application about the ready for service date and cost of the
modification.  Our rules do not require such information to be filed
with the Commission.  We note, however, that the Commission's Section
214 Streamlining Order, which will take effect in the near future,
amends Section 1.767 of the Commission's rules to require applicants
to promptly disclose to any interested party, upon written request,
accurate information concerning the location and timing for the
construction of the cable facility.

     19.   We find that TBI's concerns as to possible routing
restrictions or other practices which may discriminate against U.S.
carriers would be more appropriately presented and addressed in the
context of individual carriers' Section 214 applications than in a cable
landing license proceeding.  We see no reason to depart from the
approach taken in our Optel Conditional License decision, in which we
agreed with concerns regarding potential international routing
restrictions, but decided that such constraints should be addressed in
the context of individual carriers' Section 214 applications.  In this case,
the ability of carriers to market and provide service directly to U.S.
customers in the United States via CANUS-1 -- whether provided on a
common carrier or non-common carrier basis -- is subject to prior
Commission approval under Section 214.  Moreover, as the
Commission found in the Optel Conditional License decision, in the
event that traffic diversion results in harm to U.S. carriers or
ratepayers, the Commission can revisit the issue and take corrective
measures through the Section 214 process.  We thus conclude that no
further conditions are necessary.  

     20.  Since existing cable stations will be used for landing this
system, the application does not propose a major action within the
meaning of Section 1.305 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations
implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C.
Sections 4321-4347.  Consequently, no environmental information is
required as part of the application.

ORDERING CLAUSES

     21.  Consistent with the foregoing, we HEREBY GRANT AND
ISSUE, under the Cable Landing License Act and Executive Order No.
10530, Optel Communications, Inc. a modification to its license to land
