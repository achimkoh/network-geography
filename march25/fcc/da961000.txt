                          CABLE LANDING LICENSE


   Adopted:  November 1, 1996                                    Released:  November 5, 1996

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

     1.In this Order, we grant the application of Alaska Northstar Communications, L.L.C.,
(Alaska Northstar) under the Cable Landing License Act for authority to land and operate in
the United States a coastal submarine fiber optic cable system, to be named the "Northstar Cable
System - Extension," between two points in South Central Alaska.  The capacity of the Northstar
Cable System - Extension will be sold or leased to users on a non common carrier basis.  We
find that Alaska Northstar has provided sufficient information under our rules to comply with
the Cable Landing License Act and therefore grant the cable landing license, subject to the
conditions listed below.

                              The Application

     2.Alaska Northstar is a limited liability company organized and existing under the laws
of the Commonwealth of Virginia.  The company is owned by its two officers, both of whom
are U.S. citizens.  Alaska Northstar will own and operate the entire cable system.

     3.The exact landing points for the Northstar Cable System - Extension have yet to be
determined.  One landing station will be at or near Whittier or Seward, and the other will be at
or near Valdez.  The applicant states that the landing points will be chosen to ensure secure
submarine and land routes and to facilitate connection to U.S. domestic private and
interexchange systems.  The sites will conform to plans approved by the Secretary of the Army.

     4.The planning and development of the Northstar Cable System - Extension will be
based upon the use of submarine fiber optic technology judged suitable for implementation at
the projected ready for commercial service date, employing the appropriate transmission rate to
meet the capacity requirements of the users of the system.  The applicant expects that the system
capacity will be a minimum of 1.244 gigabits per second (Gbps).  The cable system will employ
1.55-micrometer wavelength technology and will be designed to include a minimum of two fiber
pairs.  Each fiber pair will operate at a minimum of 622 megabits per second (Mbps) per fiber
pair.  The capacity on each fiber pair will be provided in a minimum of four 155-Mbps streams,
with each 155-Mbps stream containing 84 minimum investment units (MIUs) and with each MIU
consisting of a 1.544-Mbps bit stream.  Alaska Northstar may choose to deploy more than two
fiber pairs or to increase the operating bit rate per fiber pair.  With two fiber pairs at 622 Mbps,
the minimum design capacity would be 336 MIUs per fiber pair.  Alaska Northstar will ensure
system reliability through the deployment of the appropriate cable system design.

     5.Alaska Northstar states that it will sell or lease bulk capacity of the cable system to
large users and telecommunications providers on a long-term, highly individualized basis. 
Thus, the applicant states, it will make "`individualized decisions, in particular cases, whether
and on what terms to deal' and does not intend to undertake `to carry for all people
indifferently.'"  Alaska Northstar also states that there are existing common carrier transmission
facilities serving Whittier, Valdez, and Seward.  It states that it is therefore not required to apply
for authority under section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, and it urges us to consider
its application pursuant only to the Cable Landing License Act.

     6.Alaska Northstar states that the Northstar Cable System - Extension will provide
needed additional voice, video and high-speed data transmission capacity and will offer secure,
high-quality, high-speed communications to a variety of users by interconnecting with existing
and planned Alaskan and U.S. domestic interexchange telecommunications networks.  The
introduction of high-quality, reliable, redundant, and cost-effective facilities, the applicant
asserts, will cause an immediate and significant increase in demand for and usage of improved
telecommunications capabilities.  As the first non common carrier cable along its route, it will
facilitate the introduction and expansion of new and improved telecommunicaions service
offerings.

                                 Comments

     7.The Alaska Northstar application was placed on public notice on March 15, 1996. 
No comments were received.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the
Cable Landing License Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of
State of Alaska Northstar's application.  The Department of State, after coordinating with the
National Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of Defense,
stated that it has no objection to the issuance of the requested cable landing license.

                                Discussion

     8.Alaska Northstar requests a license under the Commission's private submarine cable
policy to promote competition in the provision of international transmission facilities.  Pursuant
to this policy, the Commission has authorized non common carrier cables where there is no
legal compulsion to serve the public indifferently and no reason implicit in the nature of the
operations to expect an indifferent holding-out to the eligible user public.

     9.South Central Alaska is served by the NPC cable system, circuits on the Telstar 303
and Aurora 2 satellites, and terrestrial microwave service.  Because of the sufficient availability
of common carrier circuits along the proposed route of the Northstar Cable System - Extension,
there is no public-interest reason to require that it be operated on a common carrier basis. 
Also, in light of the sizable present and anticipated future demand for telecommunications
facilities, we see no prospect of creating significant overcapacity by the introduction of
non common carrier facilities so as to threaten the economic viability of existing common carrier
cable or satellite facilities.  Thus, there is no reason to require Alaska Northstar to operate the
proposed cable system on a common carrier basis.

     10.In addition, because Alaska Northstar will make "individualized decisions, whether
and on what terms to deal" and does not undertake to "carry for all people indifferently," there
is no reason to expect that the proposed cable circuits would be held out to the public
indifferently.  We thus conclude that Alaska Northstar will not offer capacity in Northstar
Cable System - Extension to the public on a common carrier basis and thus is not subject to
regulation under Title II of the Communications Act.

     11.Consistent with prior decisions, we find that Alaska Northstar's descriptions that
the Northstar Cable System - Extension will land at or near Whittier or Seward, Alaska, and at
or near Valdez, Alaska, to be sufficient to determine whether the proposed cable would comply
with the provisions of the Cable Landing License Act and Commission rules.  Pursuant to
Section 1.767(a)(5) of the Commission's rules, Alaska Northstar must provide a specific
description of the landing locations, including a map, no later than ninety days prior to
construction, and we condition this license upon final approval of the landing points.  The
Commission will give public notice of this description, and grant of the license will be
considered final unless we issue a public notice to the contrary no later than sixty days after
receipt of the specific description of the landing points.

     12.Based on the information provided by Alaska Northstar and pursuant to the
Commission's procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, we
conclude that a grant of the requested license would not significantly affect the environment. 
Consequently, Alaska Northstar is not required to submit an environmental assessment, and this
application is categorically excluded from environmental processing.

     13.Accordingly, we conclude that U.S. interests under the Cable Landing License Act
will be served by grant of the license to Alaska Northstar, as conditioned below.

                             Ordering Clauses

     14.Consistent with the foregoing, we hereby GRANT AND ISSUE, under the
provisions of the Cable Landing License Act and Executive Order 10530, Alaska Northstar
Communications, L.L.C., a license to land and operate a high-capacity fiber optic digital
submarine cable (two or more fiber pairs operating at a minimum of 622 Mbps per fiber pair)
extending between two points in South Central Alaska, one of which will be at or near Whittier
or Seward and the other one of which will be at or near Valdez.  This grant is subject to all
rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission; any treaties or conventions
relating to communications to which the United States is or hereafter may become a party; any
