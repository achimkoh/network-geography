                      CABLE LANDING LICENSE


   Adopted:  September 22, 1997         Released:  September 23, 1997

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

     1.  In this Order, we grant the application of SSI Atlantic Crossing, LLC, ("SSI") under the Cable
Landing License Act for authority to land and operate a digital fiber optic submarine cable system to be
called "Atlantic Crossing" or "AC-1," extending between the United States and the United Kingdom and
Germany.  This system will be operated on a non common carrier basis.  We find that SSI has provided
sufficient information under our rules to comply with the Cable Landing License Act and therefore grant
the cable landing license subject to the conditions listed below.

                         The Application

     2.  SSI, a limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the state of
Delaware, is a wholly owned subsidiary of SSI Atlantic Crossing Holdings LLC ("AC Holdings"), a
Delaware limited liability company.  AC Holdings is a wholly owned subsidiary of Submarine Systems
International, Ltd., a Delaware corporation, which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Tyco
International Limited ("Tyco"), a Bermuda corporation. 

     3.   SSI will own the portion of AC-1 that is one-half mile beyond the U.S. territorial limit to and
including the U.S. cable station.  The cables will land at a manhole on Fire Island in Brookhaven
Township, New York, and will be connected to a new cable station 8.7 miles away on Precision Drive,
where the cable system's terminal equipment will be installed.  Global Telesystems Ltd. ("GT Ltd."), a
Bermuda corporation a majority of whose equity is owned by U.S. interests, will own and operate the
portion of the cable system located in international waters, and wholly owned subsidiaries of GT Ltd.
will own and operate the portions of the system located within the United Kingdom and Germany.

     4.  The AC-1 System will employ optically amplified fiber cable operating at 10 gigabits per
second ("Gbps") per fiber pair on four fiber pairs.  This cable will feature wavelength division
multiplexing and will connect the countries involved in a "self-healing ring network."

     5.   SSI proposes to operate the AC-1 System as a non common carrier system in which capacity
will not be sold indifferently to the user public.  SSI will offer bulk capacity in the AC-1 system on the
basis of indefeasible rights of user or leases of capacity.  The applicant states that capacity on the system
will be assigned pursuant to "individualized decisions," and the offering of bulk capacity will be made
only to a "significantly restricted" class of users.

                             Comments

     6.  The application was placed on public notice on May 16, 1997.  Atlantic Express
Communications II, Ltd., L.C. ("Atlantic Express") filed a petition to deny, but that petition to deny was
received after the filing deadline, June 13, 1997.  We therefore grant SSI's request to dismiss Atlantic
Express's filing.  In any event, subsequent filings by SSI sufficiently address Atlantic Express's concerns
regarding its affiliation with a Bermuda company.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's
rules, the Cable Landing License Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of
State of the application.  The Department of State, after coordinating with the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of Defense, stated that it has
no objection to issuance of the cable landing license.

                            Discussion

     7.  SSI requests a license under the Commission's private submarine cable policy, which is
intended to promote competition in the provision of international transmission facilities.  Pursuant to
this policy, the Commission has authorized non common carrier cables where (1) there is no legal
compulsion to serve the public indifferently and (2) there are no reasons implicit in the nature of the
operations to expect an indifferent holding-out to the eligible user public.

     8.  The Commission has previously concluded that, particularly in the North Atlantic region,
private cable systems introduce meaningful competition that benefits consumers.  Because of the
sufficient availability of common carrier circuits on existing and future cables and satellite circuits
between the United States and the United Kingdom and between the United States and Germany, there
is no public interest reason to require that the applicant's proposed cable facilities be provided on a
common carrier basis.

     9.  Regarding the second prong of the test, SSI states in its application that capacity will not be
sold indifferently to the user public.  Instead, capacity will be assigned pursuant to "individualized
decisions," and bulk capacity will be offered to a "significantly restricted" class of users.  Thus, there is
no reason to expect that capacity in the proposed cable system would be held out to the public
indifferently.  

     10.  Based on the above analysis, we conclude that SSI will not offer capacity in AC-1 to the
public on a common carrier basis and that the public interest does not require that it do so.  Accordingly,
we find that the applicant will not provide a telecommunications service for a fee to such class of users
as to be "effectively available directly to the public" and thus will not be a "telecommunications carrier"
under the 1996 Act.  We therefore conclude that it is appropriate to license the AC-1 System on a
non common carrier basis.

     11.  SSI has provided the ownership information required by Section 1.767(a)(6), Section
63.18(e)(6), and Section 63.18(h) of the Commission's rules.  Although applicant is ultimately a wholly
owned subsidiary of Tyco, a Bermuda corporation, Tyco is a publicly held corporation, and a substantial
majority of its shareholders are U.S. citizens and companies.  The only shareholder with a ten percent or
greater share of the outstanding stock of Tyco is Fidelity Management and Research Company, a mutual
fund company that is incorporated in Massachusetts.  Fidelity is wholly owned by FMR Corp, another
Massachusetts corporation.  Thus, no foreign ownership concerns are raised by the application, and we
find that there is no reason to conduct an effective competitive opportunities analysis or any reciprocity
analysis pursuant to section 2 of the Cable Landing License Act.
  
     12.  SSI has complied with Section 1.767(a)(5) of the Commission's rules by providing, with its
application, specific descriptions, including maps, of the cable landing locations on the shore of the
United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany.  This license is therefore not subject to any further
public notice or Commission approval of the cable system's landing points pursuant to the procedure in
Section 1.767(a)(5).

     13.  Based on the information provided by the applicant and pursuant to the Commission's
procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, we conclude that the grant of
the requested authorization would not significantly affect the environment.  Consequently, SSI is not
required to submit an environmental assessment, and this application is categorically excluded from
environmental processing.

     14.  Accordingly, we conclude that U.S. interests under the Cable Landing License Act will be
served by grant of the license to SSI as conditioned below.

                         Ordering Clauses

     15.  Consistent with the foregoing and pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act and Executive
Order 10530, we hereby GRANT AND ISSUE SSI Atlantic Crossing LLC a license to land and operate a

     placed in service, and this license shall expire 25 years from such date, unless renewed or
     extended upon proper application, and, upon expiration of this license, all rights granted under it
     shall be terminated; and

          (11)  The terms and conditions upon which this license is given shall be accepted by the Licensee
     by filing a letter with the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, D.C.
     20554, within 30 days of the release of the cable landing license.

     16.  This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  0.261, and
is effective upon release.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106 or applications for review
