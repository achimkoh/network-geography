By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

          1.   TransGulf Communications Ltd., Inc. (TGCL) and Margus Telecom
International Ltd., (MTI) submitted the above-captioned application requesting authority to transfer
control of TGCL, a company holding a Cable Landing License to land in the United States a fiber optic
cable extending among the United States, Mexico, and other international locations, to MTI.  The
application was placed on public notice on September 11, 1998.   No comments were received.

          2.   Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing
License Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the application. 
The Department of State, after coordinating with the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration and the Department of Defense, stated that it has no objection to this application.

          3.   TGCL is a private corporation organized under the laws of the State of
Oklahoma.   In 1991, TGCL was granted authority to land a private a fiber optic cable to be located in
the Gulf of Mexico extending among the United States, Mexico and other international points.  MTI is a
private corporation organized under the laws of the State of New Jersey.  MTI does not hold any
Commission authorization.  TGCL and MTI have agreed to a transaction whereby MTI will acquire all of
the capital stock of TGCL.  TGCL will continue to exist as a wholly-owned subsidiary of MTI.

          4.   Upon consideration of the application and in view of the foregoing, we conclude
that consent to the transfer of control of TGCL to MTI  will  serve the public interest, convenience and
necessity.

          5.   Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that the application, File No. SCL-T/C-
19980904-00016 IS GRANTED, and we consent to the transfer of control of TGCL to MTI.

.         6.    This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's Rules and is
effective upon adoption.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106 or applications for review
under Section 1.115 of the Commission's Rules may be filed within 30 days of the date of public notice
