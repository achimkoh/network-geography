                     CABLE LANDING LICENSE
                                
                                
       Adopted:  April 28, 1997           Released:  April 30, 1997

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                        I. Introduction
                                
                1.    In this Order, we grant the application of GST International, Inc., (GST) under the
Cable Landing License Act  for authority to land and operate a digital fiber optic submarine
cable to be called the "Hawaii-Americas-1 System" extending between the United States and
Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Panama.  The cable will be operated on a non-common
carrier basis.  We find that GST has provided sufficient information under our rules to comply
with the Cable Landing License Act and therefore grant the cable landing license subject to the
conditions listed below.
                                
                    II. Amended Application
                                
                2.    GST, a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware, is a wholly owned
subsidiary of GST USA, Inc., itself a Delaware corporation and the wholly owned subsidiary of
GST Telecommunications, Inc. (GSTTI).  GSTTI, a corporation organized under the laws of
Canada, is a publicly held non-carrier holding company.  U.S. citizens or U.S. companies own a
majority (approximately 69.04%) of GSTTI's stock, which is traded over both the American
(AMEX) and Vancouver stock exchanges.  Aside from John Warta, a U.S. citizen who owns
10.5% of GSTTI's stock, no person or entity owns 10% or more of GSTTI.

                3.    The applicant proposes to land and operate the Hawaii-Americas-1 (HIAM-1) System
as a non-common carrier system in which capacity would be sold or leased to users on a non-
tariffed, non-common carrier basis.  The cable system would be owned by the applicant and by
entities authorized to land and operate an international submarine fiber optic cable system in
Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Panama.  All of the proposed cable system's plant and
equipment located in the United States would be owned by GST.  All plant and equipment
located in Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Panama would be owned by entities authorized to
land and operate an international submarine fiber optic cable system in those jurisdictions.  GST
initially plans to offer direct service between landing points at San Luis Obispo, California;
Oahu, Hawaii; Acapulco, Mexico; and Balboa, Panama.  GST considers Guatemala and Costa
Rica to be potential destinations for future extensions of the cable system.  GST states that U.S.
landing points will provide efficient and economical access to other international cables landing
nearby or in collocated facilities.  GST does not specify the expected date by which the proposed
cable system would be operational but commits to providing a specific description of the landing
sites no later than ninety days prior to construction.

                4.    GST's HIAM-1 System will employ SONET/SDH optically amplified fiber optic
cable and will consist of 8 fibers.  Terminal equipment and underwater repeaters with wavelength
division multiplexing (WDM) capability will enable the system capacity to grow with demand. 
The cable system will be designed to operate at 2.5 Gbps and to support the industry standard
capacity increments of E1 to DS3.

                5.    GST will offer bulk capacity in the HIAM-1 System to a specific class of eligible
users, including common carriers, on an original ownership, IRU, or lease of capacity basis. 
GST does not seek Title II authority since it will not offer services as a common carrier. 
Specifically, GST expects to make "individualized decisions, in particular cases, [on] whether
and on what terms to deal" and will not "hold itself out indifferently to serve the user public." 
GST states that since its proposed system would not constitute a bottleneck facility, no public
interest reason exists to require imposing common carrier obligations on the operation of GST's
proposed cable facilities.  Thus, GST states that only the Cable Landing License Act
requirements are relevant to this application.

                         III. Comments

                6.    The GST application was placed on public notice on December 4, 1996.  No
comments were received.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable
Landing License Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of
GST's application.  The Department of State, after coordinating with the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of Defense, stated that
it has no objection to issuance of the cable landing license.

                         IV. Discussion

                7.    GST requests a license under the Commission's private submarine cable policy to
promote competition in the provision of international transmission facilities.  Pursuant to this
policy, the Commission has authorized non-common carrier cables where there is no legal
compulsion to serve the public indifferently and where there are no reasons implicit in the nature
of the operations to expect an indifferent holding-out to the eligible user public.

                8.    Because of the wide availability of common carrier circuits on existing and future
cables and satellite circuits between the U.S. west coast and Hawaii, Mexico, and Panama, no
public interest reason exists that requires imposing common carrier obligations on the operation
of  GST's proposed cable facilities.  Specifically, we agree with GST that the existence of several
competing options prevents GST's proposed system from constituting a bottleneck.  GST states
that its proposed submarine cable system will route traffic between Asia, Australia and the
United States; between Asia, Australia and South America; and between the United States and
Central and South America.  Competitive alternatives to the proposed HIAM-1 System include,
among others, Pacific submarine cable facilities connecting the U.S. west coast with Hawaii and
the TPC, HAW, and PacRim systems; terrestrial facilities connecting the United States and
Mexico; satellite and terrestrial facilities connecting the United States and Panama; and
Caribbean submarine cable facilities.

                9.    GST states both its intention to compete with such services and its inability to restrict
output or raise prices without losing customers to such services.   GST will make
"individualized decisions, [on] whether and on what terms to deal" and will not "hold itself out
indifferently to serve the user public."  We conclude that GST will not in fact act as a common
carrier in operating the HIAM-1 System and thus is not subject to regulation under Title II of the
Communications Act.

               10.    GSTTI owns a minority interest of approximately 28.7 percent of GST Global, which
wholly owns GST Mextel, Inc.  GST Mextel, Inc., currently owns 25 percent of Bestel, S.A. de
C.V. (Bestel), and has the right to acquire up to 49 percent of Bestel.  Although it is authorized to
construct and operate telecommunications facilities in Mexico, Bestel (a company organized
under the laws of Mexico) does not yet provide service.  Pursuant to Section 63.18(h) of our
rules, even if GST Mextel, Inc., exercises its right to acquire 49 percent of Bestel, only a 14.06
percent interest in Bestel would be attributed to GSTTI.  Therefore, GST is not affiliated with
Bestel within our rules.  Under these circumstances, GST's relationship with Bestel does not raise
concerns that could persuade us to deny the application under Section 2 of the Cable Landing
License Act.  

               11.    Consistent with prior decisions, we find GST's statement that the HIAM-1 System
will land in California, Hawaii, Mexico, and Panama sufficient to determine whether the
proposed cable would comply with the provisions of the Cable Landing License Act and
Commission rules.  Section 1.767(a) of the Commission's rules permits applicants in their initial
applications to provide a general geographic description of the landing points.  It requires that
grant of cable landing license applications be conditioned on final approval of a specific
description of landing points no later than ninety days prior to construction.  The Commission
will give public notice of this description, and grant of the license will be considered final unless
we issue a public notice to the contrary no later than sixty days after receipt of the specific
description of the landing points.

               12.    Based on the information provided by GST and pursuant to the Commission's
procedures implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, we conclude that the
grant of the requested authorization would not significantly affect the environment. 
Consequently, GST is not required to submit an environmental assessment, and this application
is categorically excluded from environmental processing.

               13.    Accordingly, we conclude that U.S. interests under the Cable Landing License Act
will be served by grant of the license to GST, as conditioned below.

                      V. Ordering Clauses
                                
               14.    Consistent with the foregoing, we hereby GRANT AND ISSUE, under the provisions
of the Cable Landing License Act and Executive Order 10530, GST International, Inc., a license
to land and operate a digital non-common carrier fiber optic submarine cable system (designed to
operate at 2.5 Gbps) extending from the United States to Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and
Panama and including landing points in San Louis Obispo, California; Oahu, Hawaii; Acapulco,
Mexico; and Balboa, Panama.  This grant is subject to all rules and regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission; any treaties or conventions relating to communications to which
the United States is or may hereafter become a party; any action by the Commission or the
Congress of the United States rescinding, changing, modifying or amending any rights accruing
to any person hereunder; and the following conditions:

                (1) The location of the cable system within the territorial waters of the United
                States of America, its territories and possessions, and upon its shore shall be in
                conformity with plans approved by the Secretary of the Army, and the cables
                shall be moved or shifted by the Licensee at its expense upon the request of the
                Secretary of the Army whenever he or she considers such course necessary in
                the public interest, for reasons of national defense, or for the maintenance or
                improvement of harbors for navigational purposes;
                
                (2) The Licensee shall at all times comply with any requirements of United
                States government authorities regarding the location and concealment of the
                cable facilities, buildings, and apparatus for the purpose of protecting and
                safeguarding the cables from injury or destruction by enemies of the United
                States of America;
                
                (3) The Licensee or any persons or companies controlling it, controlled by it, or
                under direct or indirect common control with it does not enjoy and shall not
                acquire any right to handle traffic to or from the United States, its territories, or
                its possessions unless such service be authorized by the Commission pursuant to
                Section 214 of the Communications Act, as amended;
                
                (4) The Licensee or any persons or companies controlling it, controlled by it, or
                under direct or indirect common control with it shall not acquire or enjoy any
                right for the purpose of handling or interchanging traffic to or from the United
                States, its territories, or its possessions to land, connect, or operate cables or
                landlines, to construct or operate radio stations, or to interchange traffic, that is
                denied to any other United States company by reason of any concession,
                contract, understanding, or working arrangement to which the Licensee or any
                persons controlling it, controlled by it, or under direct or indirect common
                control with it are parties;
                
                (5) Neither this license nor the rights granted herein shall be transferred,
                assigned, or in any manner either voluntarily or involuntarily disposed of or
                disposed of indirectly by transfer of control of the Licensee to any persons,
                unless the Federal Communications Commission shall give prior consent in
                writing;
                
                (6) The Licensee shall notify the Commission in writing of the precise locations
                at which the cables will land no later than ninety days prior to commencing
                construction of cable landing stations at those locations.  The Commission will
                give public notice of the filing of these descriptions, and grant of this license
                will be considered final unless the Commission issues a notice to the contrary
                no later than sixty days after receipt of the specific descriptions of landing
                points;
                
                (7) The Commission reserves the right to require the Licensee to file an
                environmental assessment or environmental impact statement should it
                determine that the landing of the cables at those locations and construction of
                necessary cable landing stations would significantly affect the environment
                within the meaning of Section 1.1307 of the Commission's procedures
                implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969; this license is
                subject to modification by the Commission upon its review of any
                environmental assessment or environmental impact statement that it may require
                pursuant to its rules;
                
                (8) The Licensee shall maintain no less than a 50-percent ownership interest and
                voting control share in the cables, including 100-percent ownership in the cable
                stations in the United States and in the U.S. land portion of the cables from the
                stations to the U.S. beach joint of the submerged portion of the cables;
                
                (9) The Licensee shall, by application, obtain Commission approval prior to the
                sale or transfer to a foreign entity of five percent or more in the aggregate of
                U.S.-owned and -controlled stock;
                
                (10) This license is revocable by the Commission after due notice and
                opportunity for hearing pursuant to section 2 of "An Act Relating to the Landing
                and Operation of Submarine Cables in the United States," 47 U.S.C.  35, or for
                failure to comply with the terms of the authorizations;
                
                (11) The Licensee shall notify the Commission in writing of the date on which
                the cable is placed in service, and this license shall expire 25 years from such
                date, unless renewed or extended upon proper application, and, upon expiration
                of this license, all rights granted under it shall be terminated; and
                
                (12) The terms and conditions upon which this license is given shall be accepted
                by the Licensee by filing a letter with the Secretary, Federal Communications
                Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554, within 30 days of the release of the
                cable landing license.
                                  
                         15.    This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.
     0.261, and is effective upon release.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106
