ORDER AND AUTHORIZATION

     Adopted:   September 25, 1997     Released:  September 25, 1997

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division, International Bureau

                         I.  INTRODUCTION
    
     1.    In this Order, we grant BT North America Inc. (BTNA) authority, pursuant to
Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to provide facilities-based
international service between the United States and the United Kingdom.  We deny, however,
BTNA's request for reclassification as a non-dominant carrier for international services
between the United States and the United Kingdom.  Instead, BTNA will continue to be
regulated as a dominant carrier for all authorized services on the U.S.-U.K. route.

II.  BAC KGROUND

      2.     BTNA, a Delaware corporation, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of BT USA
Holdings, Inc., (BT USA) a Delaware Corporation.  BT USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
British Telecommunications plc (BT), a company organized under the laws of England and
Wales.  BT is the largest telecommunications operator in the United Kingdom, providing,
among other things, local, long-distance and international telephone service and
telecommunications equipment for customers' premises.  BTNA is authorized to provide
certain U.S. international switched, non-interconnected private line, interconnected private
line, and facilities-based services pursuant to Section 214 of the Act.  

      3.     On August 2, 1996, BTNA filed two applications with the Federal
Communications Commission (Commission or FCC).  First, BTNA requests authority to
acquire and operate up to the equivalent of 190 E-1 half-circuits on any and all U.S. common
carrier and non-common carrier facilities authorized by the FCC, for international service,
including common carrier and non-common carrier submarine cables landing in the United
States, intergovernmental organization satellites (such as INTELSAT), U.S.-licensed satellites,
and the earth stations used to communicate with these satellites.  BTNA also requests
authority to acquire and use any necessary domestic and foreign connecting facilities.  BTNA
seeks to provide international switched, private line, voice, video, data, television and business
service on the U.S.-U.K. route on a one-half channel or end-to-end basis.  Second, BTNA
requests that it be regulated as a non-dominant carrier for all authorized services on the U.S.-
U.K. route.  Currently, BTNA is regulated as a dominant carrier for its authorized services on
the U.S.-U.K. route.

      4.     On December 2, 1996, BT and MCI Communications Corp. (MCI)
(collectively, BT/MCI) filed applications requesting Commission approval of the transfer of
control from MCI to BT of licenses and authorizations held by subsidiaries of MCI. 
BT/MCI sought approval for this transfer in connection with the proposed merger of MCI and
BT, under which MCI would be merged into a U.S. subsidiary of BT, and would become a
subsidiary of a newly created U.K. company, Concert plc.  At the same time, BT's U.K.
operations would be placed into a subsidiary of Concert.  On August 21, 1997, the
Commission approved the merger of BT and MCI, subject to certain conditions and
safeguards. 
      
      5.     We placed BTNA's U.S.-U.K. route applications on public notice on August 9,
1996.  Frontier Communications Services Inc. (Frontier) filed comments concerning BTNA's
Section 214 application.  MCI Telecommunications Corporation (MCI) filed comments in
opposition to BTNA's motion for reclassification as a non-dominant carrier.  BTNA and the
British Embassy filed reply comments in response to Frontier's and MCI's comments.

III.  DISCUSSION
                                      
A.  BTNA Section 214 Application

      6.     BTNA's affiliation with a foreign carrier requires us to review its Section 214
application to the United Kingdom under the framework established in the Commission's
Foreign Carrier Entry Order.  In that Order, the Commission stated that carriers seeking to
provide international services to countries in which they have an affiliate with market power
must demonstrate that the affiliated market offers effective competitive opportunities (ECO)
for U.S. carriers seeking to offer like services.  The Foreign Carrier Entry Order defines
market power as the ability of the carrier to act anticompetitively against unaffiliated U.S.
carriers through the control of bottleneck services or facilities on the foreign end.  Bottleneck
services or facilities are those that are necessary for the provision of international services,
including inter-city or local access facilities on the foreign end.  Alternatively, if an
applicant can demonstrate that its foreign affiliate does not have market power in the
destination market, we do not conduct an ECO analysis.  The Commission also stated in the
Foreign Carrier Entry Order that it will continue to consider other public interest factors that
may weigh in favor of, or against, granting the application.  These factors include the general
significance of the proposed entry to the promotion of competition in the U.S.
communications market, any national security, law enforcement, foreign policy, or trade
concerns raised by the Executive Branch, and the presence of cost-based accounting rates.
      
      7.     BTNA asserts that its foreign affiliate, BT, lacks the ability to discriminate
against unaffiliated U.S. carriers through control of bottleneck facilities or services.  BTNA
also asserts that the United Kingdom satisfies each of the four factors of the Commission's
ECO test.  In addition, BTNA concludes that grant of its application is in the public
interest.  

      8.     Frontier does not oppose BTNA's application but raises questions about
whether BT offers reasonable and nondiscriminatory charges, terms and conditions for
interconnection to its domestic facilities as required by the Foreign Carrier Entry Order. 
Frontier asserts that BT does not provide timely and reasonably priced access to BT's
backhaul facilities and services.  The U.K. Government and BTNA respond that BT is
required by OFTEL to offer international facilities-based competitors reasonably priced access
to BT's backhaul facilities and services.  In addition, the U.K. Government and BTNA state
that competitive alternatives to BT for backhaul will allow carriers such as Frontier's U.K.
affiliate to bypass BT altogether.

      9.     We disagree with BTNA that its affiliate lacks market power in the U.K.
international services market.  In the BT/MCI merger decision, the Commission found, among
other things, that BTNA's U.K. affiliate, BT, possessed market power in the U.K. market
through its ownership of the only ubiquitous local access network in the United Kingdom.  As
a result, the Commission applied the "effective competitive opportunities" analysis to the U.K.
market.  

      10.    In applying the ECO analysis under Section 214 to the U.K. market, the
Commission found that the United Kingdom offers U.S. entities effective competitive
opportunities to provide international facilities-based services in the United Kingdom.  The
Commission concluded that, under the framework established in the Foreign Carrier Entry
Order, BT's entry into the U.S. market was in the public interest.  Consistent with the
Commission's decision in the BT/MCI Merger decision, we find that direct entry into the U.S.
market by BT's U.S. affiliate, BTNA, is consistent with the public interest.

      11.    With respect to Frontier's concerns, we note that in the BT/MCI Merger
decision, the Commission found that BT offered reasonable and nondiscriminatory charges,
terms and conditions for interconnection to BT's domestic facilities for termination and
origination of international services.  We therefore find that Frontier's concerns regarding
BT's interconnection obligations have been adequately addressed. 
 
      12.    In addition to our ECO analysis, our Foreign Carrier Entry Order cites other
factors that may be considered as part of our overall public interest analysis for foreign carrier
entry.  These factors include cost-based accounting rates, and any national security or law
enforcement issues, foreign policy, or trade concerns raised by the Executive Branch.

      13.    In the BT/MCI Merger Order, we concluded that BT's settlement rate on the
U.S.-U.K. route was a positive public interest factor in favor of BT's entry into the United
States market.  Consistent with that finding, we also conclude that the U.S.-U.K. settlement
rate is a positive public interest factor in favor of BTNA's entry into the United States market.

      14.    Finally, we note that the Executive Branch did not raise any national security
or law enforcement issues, foreign policy, or trade concerns.  We therefore conclude that
BTNA's entry into the U.S. market is in the public interest.

B.  BTNA Request for Non-dominant Regulatory Treatment

      15.    Under the Commission's rules, a carrier that is affiliated with a foreign carrier
that is not a monopoly in a destination market and that seeks to be regulated as a non-
dominant carrier on that route bears the burden of demonstrating that its foreign affiliate lacks
the ability to discriminate against unaffiliated U.S. international carriers through control of
bottleneck services or facilities in the destination country.  In brief, the applicant must
demonstrate that its foreign affiliate lacks market power.  

      16.    BTNA asserts that BT does not have market power in the United Kingdom and
that dominant carrier regulation of BTNA's services on the U.S.-U.K. route is no longer
justifiable.  It argues that growing competition in the U.K. local, domestic long-distance, and
international markets prevents BT from controlling bottleneck services or facilities.  Even if
BT did maintain market power, BTNA states that BT would be prevented by OFTEL's
effective regulation of BT from exercising such market power against unaffiliated carriers.
  
      17.      MCI opposes BTNA's request for non-dominant regulatory treatment on the
grounds that nothing has changed with respect to BT's market power in the U.K.
telecommunications market since the Commission decided to regulate BTNA as a dominant
carrier.  MCI further argues that while BT may be subject to stringent regulation, regulation
alone is not a substitute for effective competition.  BTNA responds that substantial changes
have occurred in the U.K. telecommunications market since the Commission decided in 1995
to regulate BTNA as dominant on the U.S.-U.K. route.  In particular, BTNA points to the
U.K.'s Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) decision to end BT's and Mercury's duopoly
on facilities-based international services and issue additional international facilities licenses to
competing carriers.  In addition, BTNA reiterates that, because BT faces effective competition
in all segments of the U.K. telecommunications market, and because it is subject to effective
regulation by OFTEL, BT cannot discriminate against unaffiliated U.S. carriers.  In response
to MCI's comments, the U.K. Government filed reply comments supporting BTNA's request
for non-dominant regulatory treatment.

      18.    As noted above, the Commission found in the BT/MCI merger decision that
BTNA's U.K. affiliate, BT, retains market power in the United Kingdom through its
ownership of the only ubiquitous local access network in the United Kingdom.  The
Commission also found that, while OFTEL plays an active role in protecting against abuse of
market power by BT, OFTEL's regulation of BT alone is not sufficient to justify non-
dominant regulation on the U.S.-U.K. route.  Thus, consistent with the BT/MCI merger
decision, we regulate BTNA as a dominant carrier.
