By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                             I.  INTRODUCTION

     1.   On May 19, 2000,  Neptune Global Systems, LLC ("Neptune Global") and C/S
Venture Investors, L.P., Carlyle U.S. Venture Partners, L.P., Carlyle Venture Partners, L.P., and
Carlyle Venture Coinvestment, L.L.C. (collectively, Carlyle, and together with Neptune Global, the
Applicants), filed an application for approval of the transfer of control of Neptune Pacific License
Corporation ("NPLC"), along with its license to land and operate a non-common carrier submarine
cable between Pacific City, Oregon and Japan, with a branching unit to Seward, Alaska (the North
Pacific Cable) from Carlyle to Neptune Global.   The Applicants submitted the application
pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act and Section 1.767 of the Commission's Rules.  For the
following reasons we grant the Applicants' request. 


                              II. BACKGROUND

     2.   Neptune Global is a Delaware limited liability company, and is owned exclusively
by U.S. citizens.  All of the directors and officers of NPLC are U.S. citizens, and all of the entities
that own, directly or indirectly, any interest in NPLC are controlled by U.S. citizens.  Applicants
assert that  Neptune Global was formed by individuals with extensive experience in the design,
construction, operation, and maintenance of submarine fiber optic cable systems.  Neptune Global
is not a telecommunications carrier nor is it affiliated with a foreign carrier.

     3.   NPLC holds the license for a non-common carrier submarine cable between Pacific
City, Oregon and Japan, with a branching unit to Seward, Alaska.  Under the proposal, the transfer
of control of NPLC will result from the transfer of control of Neptune Communications, LLC
("Neptune Communications"), which is the indirect parent company of NPLC (Neptune
Communications has 100 percent ownership of Neptune Pacific Holdings, Inc., which has 100
percent ownership of NPLC).  Neptune Communications currently is owned by Neptune Global
(28.48 percent) and Carlyle (71.52 percent).  Neptune Global proposes to acquire Carlyle's 71.52
percent ownership interest in Neptune Communications.  As a result of the proposed transaction,
Neptune Communications would be a wholly owned subsidiary of Neptune Global, and indirect
control of NPLC would pass to Neptune Global.  The cable landing license will remain with NPLC,
and NPLC will continue to operate the North Pacific Cable on a non-common carrier basis.


                        III.  DISCUSSION

     4.   Applicants request approval for the acquisition by Neptune Global of all of the
ownership interest of Neptune Communications held by Carlyle pursuant to the above-described
transaction.  The application was placed on public notice on June 2, 2000, and no parties filed
comments.  Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License
Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the application. 
The Department of State, after coordinating with the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration and the Department of Defense, stated that it had no objections to the transfer of
control of the cable landing license.

     5.   Under Section 1.767(a)(8) of the Commission's rules, Neptune Global is required to
disclose its affiliations with foreign carriers.  Neptune Global certifies that it is not, and is not
affiliated with, a foreign carrier.
                                     
     6.   Applicants assert that consummation of the proposed transaction would serve the
public interest for the same reasons the Commission recognized in granting the initial cable landing
license in 1987.  For example, Applicants assert that the North Pacific Cable provides additional
capacity, enhances competition and service reliability, and promotes technological development in
the provision of telecommunications service in the Pacific Ocean region.  Applicants assert further
that Neptune Global will ensure the continued involvement of experienced personnel in the
operation of NPLC and ensure the North Pacific Cable's continued viability.  We agree that
approval of this transaction will result in public interest benefits by promoting competition in the
Pacific Ocean region.

     7.   Upon consideration of the application and in view of the foregoing, we conclude
that a grant of the application would be consistent with the Cable Landing License Act.  We
therefore consent to the transfer of control of NPLC from Carlyle to Neptune Global.   This Order
constitutes a modification of the initial authorization to reflect this transfer of control.  We do not
modify the initial authorization in any other respect.


                            IV.  ORDERING CLAUSES

     8.   In consideration of the foregoing and pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act and
Executive order No. 10550, 47 U.S.C.  34-39, 3 U.S.C.  301, IT IS ORDERED that the
application, File No. SCL-T/C-20000519-00020 IS GRANTED, and the cable landing license,
SCL-86-002, IS MODIFIED to reflect this transfer of control.  

     10.  This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R. 
0.261, and is effective upon release.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106 or
applications for review under Section 1.115 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.106, 1.115,
may be filed within 30 days of the date of public notice of this order (see 47 C.F.R.  1.4(b)(2)).
