                       MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

    Adopted: June 19, 2000                     Released:  June 20, 2000  

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                             I.  Introduction

     1.   In this Order, we grant the application of 360networks inc. ("360networks") and
GlobeNet Communications Group Limited ("GlobeNet" and together "Applicants") seeking authority to
transfer control of the international Section 214 authorization held by TeleBermuda International
Limited ("TeleBermuda"), a subsidiary of GlobeNet, as well as interests in certain submarine cable
landing licenses held by subsidiaries of GlobeNet to 360networks, in connection with the proposed
acquisition of GlobeNet by 360networks.

                               II.  Background

     2.   360networks, a Canadian corporation headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, is
an indirect subsidiary of Ledcor Inc., a privately-held Canadian corporation with interests in the
construction and communications industries.  Through its subsidiaries, 360networks offers fiber optic
capacity to communications carriers, Internet service providers and other large end-users.  GlobeNet, a
Bermudian corporation headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda, is an independent developer of fiber-optic
cable facilities.

     3.   On March 11, 2000, 360networks and GlobeNet entered into an agreement whereby
360networks would acquire GlobeNet through the exchange of shares of 360networks for shares of
GlobeNet, pending shareholder and governmental approvals.  After the transaction is completed,
GlobeNet will become a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of 360networks.  Through the acquisition of
GlobeNet, 360networks will acquire control of GlobeNet's subsidiaries, including TeleBermuda, which
currently holds an international Section 214 authorization to provide global facilities-based and resale
service, controls an interest in the TAT-14 cable, and operates the BUS-1 cable.  Furthermore,
GlobeNet, through its subsidiary, Atlantica USA LLC, is licensed to land and operate the Atlantica-1
cable, which is currently under construction and, when complete, will connect the United States,
Venezuela, Brazil and Bermuda.

                        III.  Discussion

     4.   On March 28, 2000, Applicants submitted the above-captioned Applications
("Applications") requesting authority to transfer control of the international Section 214 authorization
held by TeleBermuda and various cable landing licenses held by GlobeNet's subsidiaries for the BUS-1,
Atlantica-1, and TAT-14 submarine cables to 360networks.  We placed the Applications on public
notice on April 7, 2000.  We received no comments.

     5.   Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License
Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the application to
transfer control of the submarine cable landing licenses.  After coordinating with the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of Defense, the Department of
State stated that it has no objection to transferring control of the submarine cable landing licenses held by
GlobeNet to 360networks.

     6.   Pursuant to Section 1.767(a)(8) of the Commission's rules, 360networks is required to
disclose its affiliations with foreign carriers.  According to the Applications, 360networks is affiliated
with non-dominant foreign carriers in Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Because Canada,
Ireland and the United Kingdom are Members of the World Trade Organization, it is presumed that
360network's affiliations with these carriers do not pose any concerns that would justify conditioning or
denying this application.  Moreover, the foreign carrier affiliates of 360networks do not have market
power in their respective markets or the ability to discriminate against unaffiliated U.S. carriers on the
foreign end of routes through the control of bottleneck facilities or services.

     7.   As the Applications state, approval of this transaction will result in economies of scale
that will allow customers to secure a broader range of value-added services for consumers while
reducing transaction costs for end-users of submarine cable capacity.

     8.   Upon consideration of the Applications and in view of the foregoing, we conclude that
this transfer of control does not raise any of the concerns listed in the Cable Landing License Act, and
that consent to transfer control of GlobeNet's interest in the above-mentioned cables to 360networks will
serve the public interest, convenience and necessity.  We therefore grant Applicants' request for
authority to transfer control of the international Section 214 authorization held by TeleBermuda as well
as GlobeNet's interests in the BUS-1, Atlantica-1, and TAT-14 submarine cables to 360networks.

                     IV.  Ordering Clauses

     9.   Consistent with the foregoing and pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act, Section
214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and Executive Order 10530, IT IS ORDERED that
Application File Nos. ITC-T/C-20000328-00186 and SCL-T/C-20000328-00010 ARE GRANTED, and
that the transfer of control of the international Section 214 authorization held by TeleBermuda
International Limited is authorized and that the transfer of control of the interests of GlobeNet
Communications Group Limited in the BUS-1, Atlantica-1 and TAT-14 cables is authorized.  The Cable
Landing Licenses of the BUS-1 cable, File No. SCL-95-009, the TAT-14 cable, File No. SCL-LIC-
19990303-00004 and the Atlantica-1 cable, File No. SCL-LIC-19990602-00010 ARE MODIFIED to
reflect this transfer of control.

     10.  This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  0.261,
and is effective upon adoption.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106 or applications for
review under Section 1.115 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.106, 1.115, may be filed within 30
days of the date of public notice of this order.
