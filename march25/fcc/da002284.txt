                 MEMORDANDUM OPINION AND ORDER


Adopted:  October 4, 2000               Released: October 6, 2000

By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:
                                

                II.Introduction and Background
1.     In this Order, we grant the application of Williams Communications, Inc. (Williams),
SBC Communications Inc. (SBC), SBCS Pacific Cable Holdings, Inc. (SBCS), and SBCI-Pacific
Networks, Inc. (PNI) (together, "Applicants"), seeking authority for:  (1) the nunc pro tunc pro
forma transfer of control of PNI from SBC to SBCS; and (2) the transfer of control to Williams
of PNI's interests in two submarine cable landing licenses.  We also grant the application of
Williams and PNI for the nunc pro tunc pro forma assignment to Williams of PNI's interests in
the two submarine cable landing licenses.
2.     On August 21, 1998, we granted the joint application of five entities, including PNI,
pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, for authority to
land and operate, on a non-common carrier basis, the China-U.S. Cable Network, extending
between the U.S. Mainland, China, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Guam.  On July 8, 1999,
the Commission granted the joint application of several entities, including PNI, pursuant to the
Cable Landing License Act and Executive Order No. 10530, for authority to land and operate, on
a non-common carrier basis, the Japan-U.S. Cable Network, extending between the U.S.
Mainland, Hawaii, and Japan.
3.     Prior to April 10, 2000, SBC International Operations, Inc. was the immediate parent
of PNI. On that date, SBCS was inserted into the corporate chain of ownership between SBC, as
ultimate parent, and PNI, as licensee.  SBCS became the immediate parent of PNI.  There was no
change in the ultimate ownership or control of the licensee, which remained a wholly owned
subsidiary of SBC.  The Application describes the transaction as pro forma in nature and seeks
nunc pro tunc approval.
4.     PNI is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware.  SBCS is a corporation
organized under the laws of Nevada.  Williams is a corporation organized under the laws of
Delaware, and is wholly owned by Williams Communications Group, Inc., a U.S. company,
which in turn is 86 percent owned by The Williams Companies, Inc., a U.S. company that is
traded publicly on the New York Stock Exchange. 
5.     Applicants assert that, under the proposed transaction, Williams would purchase PNI,
which would become a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Williams, and that PNI is, and would
remain, a licensee of the China-U.S. and Japan-U.S. cable systems.
6.     Williams and PNI filed an additional application, stating that there was an inadvertent
assignment of PNI's interests in the China-U.S. and Japan-U.S. cables to Williams prior to
Williams and PNI receiving authority for these transactions.  Williams and PNI argue that the
public interest has not been harmed by this inadvertent assignment.  They describe this
assignment as pro forma in nature and ask for authority nunc pro tunc to assign the licenses to
Williams.  
                        II.Discussion
7.     On May 10, 2000, the Applicants submitted the above-captioned Application seeking
authority to transfer control of PNI's interests in the two submarine cable landing licenses from
SBCS to Williams through the sale of PNI to Williams.  On May 19, 2000, we put the
Application on public notice.  We received no comments.  
8.     Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commission's rules, the Cable Landing License
Act, and Executive Order No. 10530, we informed the Department of State of the Application. 
After coordinating with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and
the Department of Defense, the Department of State stated that it has no objection to the
proposed transfer of control of the two cable landing licenses held by PNI.
9.     On May 23, 2000, the Applicants filed a Request for Special Temporary Authority
(STA) to transfer to Williams control of the two submarine cable landing licenses held by PNI. 
Applicants asserted that they needed the STA by June 14, 2000, to enable Williams to provide
uninterrupted service to customers on the China-U.S. cable system.  On June 9, 2000, we
granted the STA, by grant stamp, with an expiration date of December 6, 2000.  On July 21,
2000, counsel for Williams advised the Commission that, on June 23, 2000, PNI was sold to
Williams.
10.    Pursuant to Section 1.767(a)(8) of the Commission's rules, Applicants disclose
Williams' affiliations with foreign carriers.  Applicants certify that Williams is affiliated with
foreign carriers in Australia, Brazil, Singapore, and the United Kingdom.  Therefore, as a result
of the transfer of control to Williams, PNI will have affiliations with foreign carriers in each of
these countries.  Each of these countries is a Member of the World Trade Organization. 
Therefore, we presume that Applicants' affiliations with these carriers do not pose any concerns
that would justify denying the applications.
11.    Applicants have characterized as pro forma the transfer of control of PNI from SBC
to SBCS and the assignment of licenses from PNI to Williams.  We agree with this
characterization because both transactions are similar to categories of transactions that, in
contexts other than submarine cable landing licenses, we have deemed to be pro forma.
12.    Applicants have stated that approval of these transactions will serve the public interest
because it will enhance international competition by allowing Williams to provide its carrier
services as soon as possible. 
13.    Upon consideration of the record in this proceeding, and in view of the foregoing, we
conclude that grant of the transfer of control (including the pro forma transfer of control) sought
in the Application and the pro forma assignment of licenses sought in the Assignment
Application will serve the public interest and is consistent with the Cable Landing License Act. 
We find it reasonable in this instance to grant the nunc pro tunc requests made in these
applications.  We caution Applicants, however, that the Commission's rules require prior
approval of such transfers of control and assignments of licenses and urge Applicants to plan
accordingly in the future.
14.    We modify the initial authorizations to reflect these transactions.  We do not modify
the initial authorizations in any other respect.
                     III.Ordering Clauses
15.    Consistent with the foregoing and pursuant to the Cable Landing License Act and
Executive Order 10530, IT IS ORDERED that Applications Nos. SCL-T/C-20000510-00017 and
SCL-ASG-20000929-00032 ARE GRANTED, the transactions listed herein are authorized, and

License (File No. SCL-LIC-19981117-00025) ARE HEREBY MODIFIED to reflect these
transactions.
16.    This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R. 
0.261, and is effective upon release.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106 or
applications for review under Section 1.115 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.106,
1.115, may be filed within 30 days of the date of public notice of this order.
