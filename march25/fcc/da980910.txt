                   MODIFICATION OF CABLE LANDING LICENSE

        Adopted:  May 12, 1998                          Released:  May 15, 1998


By the Chief, Telecommunications Division:

                             I.  Introduction
 
  1.    In this Cable Landing License, we modify the cable landing license granted to several
parties for authority to land and operate a digital submarine cable system, COLUMBUS II Cable
System ("COLUMBUS II").  We grant the application of Telef묥ica Larga Distancia de Puerto Rico,
Inc. ("TLD") under the Cable Landing License Act to add TLD as a licensee of  COLUMBUS II for
the provision of service between the United States and Spain.  COLUMBUS II operates on a common
carrier basis and extends between landing points in the United States, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, Italy. 
We find that TLD has provided sufficient information under the Commission's rules to comply with
the Cable Landing License Act and therefore grant the cable landing license modification subject to
the conditions discussed below.

                     II.  Application and Pleadings  

  2.     TLD is a corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. 
The Puerto Rico Telephone Authority ("PRTA") owns 19% of TLD's stock.  Another 2% in TLD is
held in an employee stock ownership plan.  The remaining 79% of TLD is owned by Telef묥ica
International Holding, B.V. ("TI Holding").  TI Holding, a Netherlands corporation, is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Telef묥ica de Espa바, S.A. ("TI"), a corporation organized under the laws of Spain.  TI
is 100% owned by Telef묥ica de Espa바, S.A. ("Telef묥ica de Espa바"), which provides domestic and
international communications services in Spain.   

  3.     TLD proposes to acquire 3 half-Minimum Investment Units ("MIU") in COLUMBUS
II for service between the United States and Spain.  TLD will use the 3 half-MIUs to correspond with
Telef묥ica de Espa바.  These interests together with TLD's other ownership interests in COLUMBUS
II (which have already been approved by the Commission), will bring TLD's total ownership interest
in COLUMBUS II to 1.47421 percent.  Carriers, including non-owners, may acquire capacity in
COLUMBUS II by indefeasible rights of user ("IRUs"), lease, or other mutually agreed upon
arrangements.  

  4.     COLUMBUS II extends between landing points on the U.S. mainland (West Palm
Beach, Florida), St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands; Cancun, Mexico; Funchal, Portugal; Sardina, Spain;
and Palermo, Italy.  COLUMBUS II consists of nine main segments: six cable stations and three
cables connecting the stations.  

                             III.  Background

  5.     On November 10, 1992, eight U.S. carriers, including TLD's predecessor, LD, filed
joint Section 214 and submarine cable landing license applications for authority to construct and
operate the COLUMBUS II and AMERICAS-1 Cable Systems.  On July 26 and 28, 1993, the
Common Carrier Bureau approved the Joint Applications for these cable systems for seven U.S.
carriers but deferred action on TLD's application pending a determination by the full Commission. 
On August 8, 1994, the Commission granted TLD's request for authority to participate in the
construction, acquisition of capacity in, and operation of COLUMBUS II, but deferred ruling on
TLD's request for a cable landing license until the views of the State Department were received.      


  6.     On May 2, 1997, the Commission denied TLD's application to acquire ownership
interests in COLUMBUS II.  The Commission found that U.S. carriers were denied effective
competitive opportunities ("ECO") to have ownership interests in cable facilities landing in Spain.  

  7.     On January 30, 1998, TLD filed the instant application to land and operate a digital
submarine cable system between the United States and Spain.  We placed TLD's application on public
notice on February 11, 1998.  On March 11, 1998 Sprint Communications Company, L.P. ("Sprint")
filed comments requesting that the Commission condition any grant of TLD's application for a cable
landing license upon compliance with the Commission's accounting rate benchmarks and other
competitive safeguards.  The Commission addresses Sprint's comments in the order granting TLD's
application for Section 214 authority to provide service to Spain via COLUMBUS II.

                              IV.  Discussion

  8.     Pursuant to Section 1.767(b) of the Commissions rules, the Cable Landing License
Act, and Executive Order 10530, we informed the Department of State of the application.  The
Department of State, after coordinating with the Department of Commerce's National
Telecommunications and Information Administration and the Department of Defense, advised the
Commission that it has no objection to the modification of the cable landing license.

    9.     TLD certifies that it is affiliated with a foreign carrier in Spain.  Thus, we evaluate
this application under the policies adopted by the Commission in its recent Foreign Participation
Order.  In that Order, the Commission decided to apply its open entry policies to applications to land
and operate submarine cables between the United States and World Trade Organization ("WTO")
Member Countries.  Because Spain is a WTO Member Country, we do not apply our ECO analysis,
and we presume that there is no competition-based reason to deny TLD's application.  No party has
suggested that this presumption should be rebutted for this application.  Therefore, we find that TLD's
foreign affiliation does not raise concerns that could persuade us to deny the application under Section
2 of the Cable Landing License Act.

  10.    Accordingly, we conclude that U.S. interests under the Cable Landing License Act will
be served by grant of the modification to TLD to land and operate COLUMBUS II, subject to all of
the terms and conditions in the original cable landing license.
  
                           V.  Ordering Clauses

  11.     In consideration of the foregoing, IT IS ORDERED that the application, File No.
SCL-93-001(M) is GRANTED.  The COLUMBUS II cable landing license, SCL-93-001, is
MODIFIED to add Telef묥ica Larga Distancia de Puerto Rico, Inc., as a licensee.  This grant is
subject to all rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission; any treaties or
conventions relating to communications to which the United States is or may hereafter become a party;
any action by the Commission or the Congress of the United States rescinding, changing, modifying or
amending any rights accruing to any person hereunder; and the conditions contained in the cable
landing license, SCL-93-001.

  12.    TLD shall accept the terms and conditions of this license by filing a letter with the
Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, D.C. 20554 within 30 days of the
release of this modification.

  13.    This Order is issued under Section 0.261 of the Commissions rules, 47 C.F.R.  0.261,
and is effective upon adoption.  Petitions for reconsideration under Section 1.106 or applications for review under Section 1.115 of the Commission's rules, 47 C.F.R.  1.106, 1.115, may be filed within
30 days of the date of public notice of this order (see 47 C.F.R.  1.4(b)(2)).
